But I think that’s a boring interpretation of the question. These trends come and go as part of hype cycles that represent the waxing and waning of media interest in a particular technology. Instead I answer, “Oh, nothing much—just the end of the Industrial Age.” That momentous change is the subject of this book. 作为一名风险资本家，我经常被问到： \"下一个大事情是什么？\" 人们往往在寻找技术趋势时问这个问题，希望我跟他们谈谈机器人技术或虚拟现实。但我认为这是对这类问题的无聊解释。这些趋势来来去去都是炒作周期的一部分，代表了媒体对某一特定技术兴趣的消长变化。相反，我回答说：\"哦，没什么--只是工业时代的结束。\" 这一重大变化是本书的主题。 The World After Capital is unabashedly about some truly big subjects. In order to tackle why the Industrial Age is ending and what is coming next, I will examine such things as the nature of technology and what it means to be human. It might seem a wildly ambitious thesis, but I argue that we are facing a transition as profound as the one which took humanity from the Agrarian Age to the Industrial Age, so nothing less will do. 《资本后的世界》毫不掩饰地讲述了一些真正的大主题。为了解决工业时代即将结束的原因，以及接下来会发生什么，我将研究技术的性质和人类意义等问题。这似乎是一个雄心勃勃的论题，但我认为我们正面临着一个深刻的转变，就像人类从农业时代到工业时代的转变一样，所以没有什么比这更重要了。 The current transition has been made possible by the advent of digital technology, so it is essential that we understand the nature of this technology and how it differs from what preceded it. It is also essential that we examine the philosophical foundations of what we want to accomplish—after all, we have the opportunity to decide what will follow the Industrial Age. In The World After Capital I argue that we are now entering the Knowledge Age, and that in order to get there we must focus on the allocation of attention rather than capital. 目前的转型由于数字技术的出现而成为可能，因此，我们必须了解这种技术的性质，以及它与之前的技术有什么不同。同样重要的是，我们要研究我们想要完成的事情的哲学基础--毕竟，我们有机会决定工业时代之后的事情。在《资本后的世界》中，我认为我们现在正在进入信息时代，为了达到这个目的，我们必须关注注意力的分配，而不是资本。 Markets fail at allocating attention because prices cannot exist for directing our attention to problems and opportunities most crucial for the survival and thriving of humanity. The climate crisis, for instance, is both more severe and more imminent than most people realize, and it is a direct result of our failure to pay attention. How quickly we address this crisis will to a great extent determine the shape of the current transition. If we do not make drastic changes quickly, getting to the next age will be even more painful than the transition to the Industrial Age, which started in the eighteenth century, involved numerous violent revolutions, and didn’t conclude until the end of the Second World War. 市场在分配注意力方面失败了，因为价格无法为我们将注意力引向对人类生存和繁荣最为关键的问题和机遇。例如，气候危机比大多数人意识到的更严重、更紧迫，它是我们未能关注的直接结果。我们如何迅速解决这一危机将在很大程度上决定当前转型的形式。如果我们不迅速做出巨大的改变，进入下一个时代将比向工业时代的过渡更加痛苦，后者始于18世纪，涉及无数次暴力革命，直到第二次世界大战结束才结束。 The transition from the Industrial Age is already underway, and has caused massive disruption and uncertainty. Many people are fearful of change, and react by supporting populist politicians who promote the simplistic message that we should return to the past. This is happening all over the world. We saw it with the vote in the 2016 UK referendum to leave the European Union, and with the election of Donald Trump as President of the United States in the same year. I started writing The World After Capital before both of those events, but they underline the importance of a future-oriented narrative that shows a path forward for humanity. Going back is not a viable option, and never has been. We did not continue foraging for food after the invention of agriculture, nor did we remain farmers after the invention of industry (farming is still important, of course, but it is carried out by a tiny percentage of the population). Each of these transitions required us to find new sources of purpose. As we leave the Industrial Age behind, our purpose can no longer be derived from having a job or from an ever-growing consumption of material goods. Instead, we need to find a purpose that is compatible with the Knowledge Age. I feel incredibly fortunate to have found my purpose in advancing innovation through investing in startups, as well as in examining why this transition is happening now and suggesting how we might go about it. 从工业时代的过渡已经在进行中，并造成了巨大的破坏和不确定性。许多人对变化感到恐惧，会通过支持鼓吹简单信息的民粹主义政治家来反应，认为我们应该回到过去。这种情况正在世界各地发生，我们看到，在2016年英国公投中，人们投票决定离开欧盟，同年唐纳德-特朗普当选美国总统，也是如此。我在这两个事件之前就开始写《资本后的世界》，但它们强调了面向未来的叙事的重要性，为人类指明了前进的道路。回归不是一个可行的选择，而且从来都不是。在农业发明之后，我们没有继续采集狩猎，在工业发明之后，我们也没有继续当农民（当然，耕作仍然很重要，但它是由极小部分的人口进行的）。这些过渡都要求我们找到新的目的来源。当我们离开工业时代时，我们的目的不能再从拥有一份工作或从不断增长的物质产品消费中获得。相反，我们需要找到一个与信息时代相适应的目的。我感到非常幸运的是，我在通过投资初创企业来推动创新方面找到了自己的目的，同时也在研究为什么现在正在发生这种转变，并建议我们如何去做。 In a strange and wonderful way, much of what I have done in my life so far has brought me to this point. As a teenager in my native Germany in the early 1980s, I fell in love with computers. I started writing software for companies and then studied economics and computer science as an undergraduate at Harvard, writing my senior thesis on the impact of computerized trading on stock prices. After graduating I worked as a consultant and experienced the impact of information systems on the automotive, airline and electric utility industries. As a doctoral student at MIT, I wrote my dissertation on the impact of information technology on the organization of companies. As an entrepreneur, I co-founded an early Internet healthcare company. And as a venture investor, I have had the good fortune to back companies that provide transformative digital technologies and services, including Etsy, MongoDB and Twilio. 以一种奇怪而奇妙的方式，迄今为止我在生活中所做的大部分事情都把我带到了这一点上。20世纪80年代初，在我的家乡德国，我还是个少年，就爱上了计算机。我开始为公司编写软件，然后在哈佛大学读本科时学习经济学和计算机科学，写了一篇关于计算机化交易对股票价格影响的毕业论文。毕业后，我担任了顾问，体验了信息系统对汽车、航空和电力行业的影响。作为麻省理工学院的博士生，我的论文写的是信息技术对公司组织的影响。作为一名企业家，我与他人共同创办了一家早期的互联网保健公司。而作为一个风险投资者，我有幸支持了那些提供变革性数字技术和服务的公司，包括Etsy、MongoDB和Twilio。 You might be wondering why I would choose to write this book as a VC—after all, surely it’s a distraction from finding and managing investments in startups? However, working with startups gives me a window into the future: I get to see trends and developments before they become widely understood, and this puts me in a good position to write about what is going to happen. At the same time, writing about the future that I would like to see will help me find companies that can help bring that future about. I am writing The World After Capital because what I see compels me to do so, but I am also confident that writing it has made me a better investor. 你可能会想，为什么我会选择以风险投资人的身份来写这本书--毕竟，这肯定会分散我对寻找和管理初创企业投资的注意力？然而，与初创企业一起工作给了我一个了解未来的窗口： 我可以在趋势和发展被广泛了解之前看到它们，这使我处于一个很好的位置来写即将发生的事情。同时，撰写我希望看到的未来，将有助于我找到能够帮助实现这一未来的公司。我写《资本后的世界》是因为我看到的东西迫使我这样做，但我也相信，写这本书使我成为一个更好的投资者。 ‍ "},"docs/Introduction.html":{"url":"docs/Introduction.html","title":"引言","keywords":"","body":"Introduction 引言 Humanity is the only species on Earth to have developed knowledge. I will make the term ‘knowledge’ increasingly precise as we go along, but for now I will simply say that we are the only species that is able to read and write, and that this ability in turn has allowed us to create increasingly powerful technology. Technological advance has the effect of broadening the ‘space of the possible’: for instance, with the invention of the airplane, human flight became a reality. When the ‘space of the possible’ is broadened, it brings with it both good and bad capabilities. This duality of technology has been with us since we learned to start a fire, the very first human technology. With this discovery, it became possible to warm ourselves and cook, but also to burn down forests and enemy villages. Today, the Internet broadens free access to learning, but it can also spread hate and lies on a global scale. 人类是地球上唯一发展知识的物种。随着时间的推移，我将使 \"知识 \"一词越来越精确，但现在我只想说，我们是唯一能够阅读和书写的物种，而这种能力反过来又使我们能够创造出越来越强大的技术。技术进步具有扩大 \"可能的空间 \"的作用：例如，随着飞机的发明，人类飞行成为现实。当 \"可能的空间 \"被扩大时，它带来了好的和坏的能力。自从我们学会生火以来，技术的这种双重性一直伴随着我们，这是人类最早的技术。有了这一发现，我们就可以取暖和做饭，但也可以烧毁森林和敌人的村庄。今天，互联网扩大了自由学习的机会，但它也可以在全球范围内传播仇恨和谎言。 And yet there is something special about our time: we are experiencing a technological non-linearity, in which the ‘space of the possible’ expands dramatically, thus rendering predictions based on extrapolation useless. The current non-linearity arises from the extraordinary power of digital technology, which far exceeds anything that was possible with industrial machinery, due to two unique characteristics. Digital technology delivers universality of computation (it can potentially solve any solvable problem) at zero marginal cost (extra copies can be produced for free). 然而，我们的时代有一些特别之处：我们正在经历一场技术上的非线性，其中 \"可能的空间 \"急剧扩大，从而使基于推断的预测变得无用。目前的非线性产生于数字技术的非凡力量，由于两个独特的特点，它远远超过了工业机械的任何可能。数字技术提供了计算的普遍性（它可以潜在地解决任何可解决的问题），而且边际成本为零（可以免费生产额外的副本）。 To understand what is happening, we therefore need to zoom out in time. Humanity has previously encountered two similar non-linearities. The first occurred roughly ten thousand years ago with the invention of agriculture, which ended the Forager Age and brought us into the Agrarian Age. The second started with the Enlightenment about four hundred years ago, which helped usher in the Industrial Age. 因此，为了理解正在发生的事情，我们需要将时间放大。人类以前曾遇到过两次类似的非线性现象。第一次大约发生在一万年前，农业的发明结束了采集-狩猎时代，使我们进入了农业时代。第二次发生在大约四百年前的启蒙运动，它帮助我们进入了工业时代。 Consider foragers one hundred thousand years ago, trying to predict what society would look like after the invention of agriculture. Even something that seems as trivially obvious to us as living in buildings would be hard to imagine from the viewpoint of migratory tribes. Similarly, much of what we have today—from modern medicine to computer technology—would resemble magic to those living as recently as the mid-twentieth century. Not simply the existence of smartphones, but also the widespread availability and affordability of such powerful technology, would have been hard to foresee. 考虑一下十万年前的采集-狩猎者，试图预测农业时代后社会会是什么样子。即使是像住在楼房里这样对我们来说似乎微不足道的事情，但从迁徙部落的角度来看也是难以想象的。同样，我们今天所拥有的大部分东西--从现代医学到计算机技术--对于那些生活在二十世纪中期的人来说，就像魔术一样。不仅仅是智能手机的存在，还有这种强大技术的广泛可用性和可负担性，都是难以预见的。 The World After Capital has two goals. The first is to establish that we are currently experiencing a third period of globally transformative, non-linear change. The key argument is that each time, the ‘space of the possible’ expands dramatically, the defining constraint for humanity shifts—meaning the allocation problem that most fundamentally needs to be solved in order to meet humanity’s needs changes. Specifically, the invention of agriculture shifted scarcity from food to land, and industrialization shifted scarcity from land to capital (which throughout The World After Capital refers to physical capital, such as machines and buildings, unless otherwise noted). Digital technology is now shifting scarcity from capital to attention. 资本后的世界有两个目标。第一个目标是确定我们目前正在经历第三个全球转型、非线性变化的时期。关键的论点是，每一次，\"可能的空间 \"急剧扩大，人类的决定性制约因素就会发生变化--也就是说，为了满足人类的需求，最根本的需要解决的分配问题就会发生变化。具体来说，农业的发明将稀缺性从食物转移到了土地，而工业化将稀缺性从土地转移到了资本（除非另有说明，在《资本后的世界》中，资本指的是物质资本，如机器和建筑物）。现在，数字技术正在将稀缺性从资本转移到注意力。 Capital is no longer scarce in some parts of the world and it is becoming rapidly less scarce everywhere. We should consider this to be the great success of capitalism. But markets, which were the crucial allocation mechanism for capital, will not solve the scarcity of attention. We are bad at allocating attention, both individually and collectively. For example, how much attention do you pay to your friends and family, or to the existential question of the meaning of your life? And how much attention are we paying as humanity to the great challenges and opportunities of our time, such as the climate crisis and space travel? Markets are not able to help us better allocate attention because prices do not, and cannot, exist for many of the issues that we should be paying attention to. Consider paying attention to finding your purpose in life: there is no supply and demand that will form a ‘purpose price’ for an individual; it’s ultimately up to you to allocate enough attention to this existential question. 资本在世界的某些地方不再稀缺，而且在各地的稀缺程度也在迅速降低。我们应该认为这是资本主义的巨大成功。但是，作为资本的重要分配机制的市场，并不能解决注意力的稀缺性问题。我们不善于分配注意力，无论是个人还是集体。例如，你会给你的朋友和家人以及你生命意义的存在问题多少关注？而作为人类，我们对我们这个时代的巨大挑战和机遇，如气候危机和太空旅行，又有多少关注？市场无法帮助我们更好地分配注意力，因为对于许多我们应该关注的问题，价格并不存在，也不可能存在。考虑关注寻找你的人生目标：没有任何供求关系会形成一个人的 \"目标价格\"；最终取决于你是否对这个存在的问题分配足够的关注。 My second goal in writing The World After Capital is to propose an approach that will help us overcome the limitations and remedy the shortcomings of market-based capitalism, in order to facilitate a smooth transition from the Industrial Age (in which the key scarcity is capital) to the Knowledge Age (in which the key scarcity is attention). Getting this right will be critical for humanity, as the two previous transitions were marked by massive turmoil and upheaval. We are already seeing signs of increasing conflict within societies and among belief systems across the world, fueling a rise of populist and nationalist leaders, including Donald Trump in the US. 我写《资本后的世界》的第二个目标是提出一种方法，帮助我们克服以市场为基础的资本主义的局限性并弥补其缺陷，以促进从工业时代（其中关键的稀缺性是资本）向信息时代（其中关键的稀缺性是注意力）顺利过渡。把握好这一点对人类来说至关重要，因为前两次转型的特点是大规模的动荡和骚乱。我们已经看到世界各地的社会内部和信仰体系之间的冲突越来越多的迹象，助长了民粹主义和民族主义领导人的崛起，包括美国的唐纳德-特朗普。 How should we approach this third transition? What actions should society take now, when the non-linearity we are facing prevents us from being able to make accurate predictions about the future? We need to enact policies that allow for gradual social and economic change. The alternative is that we artificially suppress these changes, only for them to explode eventually. In particular, I will argue that we should smooth the transition to the Knowledge Age by expanding three powerful individual freedoms: Economic freedom: instituting a universal basic income. Informational freedom: broadening access to information and computation. Psychological freedom: practicing and encouraging mindfulness. 我们应该如何对待这第三次转型？当我们所面临的非线性使我们无法对未来做出准确的预测时，社会现在应该采取什么行动？我们需要制定政策，允许社会和经济的逐步变化。另一种选择是，我们人为地压制这些变化，但最终它们会爆发出来。特别是，我将论证，我们应该通过扩大三种强大的个人自由来平稳过渡到信息时代： 经济自由：实施普遍基本收入。 信息自由：扩大信息和计算的获取渠道。 心灵自由：实践和鼓励正念。 Increasing these three freedoms will make attention less scarce. Economic freedom will unlock the time that we currently spend in jobs that can and should be automated. Informational freedom will accelerate the creation and distribution of knowledge. And psychological freedom enables rationality in a world in which we are overloaded with information. Each of these freedoms is important in its own right, but they are also mutually reinforcing. 增加这三种自由将会使得注意力不再那么紧缺。经济自由将会释放我们当前在那些可以和应该被自动化的工作中所花费的时间。信息自由将会加速知识的创造和传播。而心灵自由则使我们在这个信息过载的世界中能够更理性地处理问题。每一种自由都有其重要性，但它们也是相互支持的。 One crucial goal in reducing the scarcity of attention is to improve the functioning of the ‘knowledge loop’, which is the source of all knowledge and which consists of learning, creating and sharing. Producing more knowledge is essential to human progress. The history of humanity is littered with failed civilizations that didn’t produce enough knowledge to overcome the challenges facing them. 降低注意力稀缺的一个至关重要的目标是改善“知识循环”的功能，这是所有知识的源泉，由学习、创造和分享组成。生产更多的知识对于人类的进步至关重要。人类的历史上充满了失败的文明，它们没有产生足够的知识来克服面临的挑战。 To achieve collective progress through increased individual freedoms, we must establish a set of values that include critical inquiry, democracy and responsibility. These values ensure that the benefits of the knowledge loop accrue broadly to humanity and extend to other species. They are central to a renewed humanism, which in turn has an objective basis in the existence and power of human knowledge. Reasserting humanism is especially critical at a time when we are coming close to creating ‘transhumans’ through genetic engineering and augmentation, as well as ‘neohumans’ through artificial intelligence. 为了通过增加个体自由实现集体进步，我们必须确立一组价值观，包括批判性探究、民主和责任。这些价值观确保知识循环的好处广泛地惠及人类并延伸到其他物种。它们是一种重新振兴的人道主义的核心，而这种人道主义又以人类知识的存在和力量为客观基础。在我们即将通过基因工程和增强技术创造“超人类”以及通过人工智能创造“新人类”之际，重新确立人道主义尤其关键。 The World After Capital argues that only this combination of increased freedoms and strong humanist values will allow us to safely navigate the transition from the Industrial Age to the Knowledge Age. Though I am profoundly optimistic about the ultimate potential for human progress, I am pessimistic about how we will get there. We seem intent on clinging to the Industrial Age at all costs, which increases the likelihood of violent change. My hope is that in writing this book I can in some small way help to move us forward peacefully. 《资本后的世界》认为，只有这种增加自由和强有力的人文主义价值观的结合，才能使我们安全地度过从工业时代到信息时代的过渡期。尽管我对人类进步的最终潜力是乐观，但我对我们将如何达到这一目标感到悲观。我们似乎有意不惜一切代价坚持工业时代，这增加了暴力变革的可能性。我希望通过写这本书，我可以以某种小小的方式帮助我们和平地向前迈进。 ‍ "},"docs/Digital_Technology.html":{"url":"docs/Digital_Technology.html","title":"数字技术","keywords":"","body":"Digital Technology 数字技术 Billions of people all over the world carry around smartphones, powerful computers that are connected to a global network (the Internet). We often spend many hours a day on these devices, whether playing games or carrying out work. And yet despite the growing ubiquity of digital technology, people often find it difficult to understand what exactly makes it so distinctively powerful. Some have even derided digital technology, pointing to services such as Twitter and arguing that they are inconsequential when compared to, say, the invention of vaccines. 全球亿万人民都携带着智能手机，这些强大的计算机连接着全球网络（即互联网）。我们经常花费很多时间在这些设备上，无论是玩游戏还是工作。尽管数字技术的普及度越来越高，但人们经常发现很难理解它究竟是如何具有如此独特的强大能力。有些人甚至嘲笑数字技术，并指出像Twitter这样的服务与疫苗的发明相比毫无意义。 It is nonetheless becoming increasingly difficult to ignore digital technology’s disruptiveness. For example, while many previously long-established businesses are struggling, including newspapers and retailers, digital technology companies such Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google are now among the world’s most highly valued (“List of public corporations,” 2020). 尽管如此，越来越难以忽视数字技术的破坏性。例如，许多以前长期存在的企业正面临困境，包括报纸和零售商，而像Facebook、苹果、亚马逊、奈飞和谷歌这样的数字技术公司现在已成为全球最有价值的公司之一（“上市公司列表”，2020）。 Digital technology turns out to possess two unique characteristics that explain why it dramatically expands the ‘space of the possible’ for humanity, going far beyond anything that was previously possible. These are zero marginal cost and the universality of computation. 数字技术具有两个独特的特点，这解释了为什么它能大大扩展人类的“可能空间”，远远超出以前的任何可能性。这两个特点是零边际成本和计算的普适性。 Zero Marginal Cost 零边际成本 Once a piece of information exists on the Internet, it can be accessed from anywhere on the network for no additional cost. And as more and more people around the world are connected to the Internet, ‘anywhere on the network’ is increasingly coming to mean ‘anywhere in the world’. The servers are already running, as are the network connections and the end-user devices. Making one extra digital copy of the information and delivering it across the network therefore costs nothing. In the language of economics, the ‘marginal cost’ of a digital copy is zero. That does not mean that people won’t try to charge you for this information—in many cases they will. But that's a matter of price, not of cost. 一旦一条信息存在于互联网上，它就可以在网络上的任何地方免费访问。随着全球越来越多的人连接到互联网，“网络上的任何地方”越来越多地意味着“世界上的任何地方”。服务器已经在运行，网络连接和终端设备也已经在使用。因此，制作一份额外的数字副本并将其传送到网络上不会产生任何成本。用经济学的语言来说，数字副本的“边际成本”为零。这并不意味着人们不会试图向你收费——在许多情况下，他们会这样做。但这是价格问题，而不是成本问题。 Zero marginal cost is radically different to anything that has come before it in the analog world, and it makes some pretty amazing things possible. To illustrate this, imagine that you own a pizzeria. You pay rent for your store and your equipment, and you pay salaries for your staff and yourself. These are so-called ‘fixed costs,’ and they don’t change with the number of pizzas you bake. ‘Variable costs,’ on the other hand, depend on the number of pizzas you make. For a pizzeria, these will include the cost of the water, the flour, any other ingredients you use, any additional workers you need to hire, and the energy you need to heat your oven. If you make more pizzas, your variable costs go up, and if you make fewer pizzas they go down. 零边际成本在模拟世界中与以往的任何事物都截然不同，它使一些非常惊人的事情成为可能。为了说明这一点，请想象你拥有一家比萨店。你为店铺和设备支付租金，并支付员工和自己的工资。这些是所谓的“固定成本”，它们不随你烤的比萨数量而改变。““可变成本”则取决于你制作的比萨数量。对于一家比萨店来说，对于一家比萨店来说，这些成本包括水费、面粉费、你使用的任何其他原料费用、你需要雇佣的任何额外工人以及加热烤箱所需的能源费用。如果你制作更多的比萨，你的可变成本会增加，如果你制作较少的比萨，它们会减少。 So what is marginal cost? Well, let’s say you are making one hundred pizzas every day: the marginal cost is the additional cost of making one more pizza. Assuming the oven is already hot and has space in it, and your employees aren’t fully occupied, it is the cost of the ingredients, which is likely relatively low. If the oven had already cooled, then the marginal cost of the additional pizza would include the energy cost required for reheating the oven and might be quite high. 现在，假设您可以通过数字技术向整个世界提供在线披萨订单服务。您需要购买并设置一个服务器以处理订单，还需要支付互联网接入费用。这些都是初始成本，您需要在开始运营之前支付它们。但是，一旦您的服务器和接入点设置好，您可以从世界任何地方接收订单，对于接收一个订单，其边际成本仍然是零。这是因为，与制作披萨不同，您不需要增加任何材料或工作人员来处理额外的订单。当然，如果您的网站开始变得非常受欢迎，您可能需要扩大服务器和接入点的规模，以应对更高的流量和工作负载，但这不会导致订单边际成本的增加。简而言之，数字技术带来了零边际成本的可能性，这使得我们可以通过网络实现许多以前被视为不可能的事情。 From a business perspective, you would want to make that additional pizza as long as you could sell it for more than its marginal cost. If you had already covered your fixed costs from the previous pizzas, every cent above marginal cost for the additional pizza would be profit. Marginal cost also matters from a social perspective. As long as a customer is willing to pay more than the marginal cost for that pizza, everyone is potentially better off—you get an extra contribution towards your fixed costs or your profits, and your customer gets to eat a pizza they wanted (important note: I am saying “potentially better off” for a reason because people sometimes want things that might not actually be good for them, such as someone suffering from obesity wanting to eat a pizza). 从商业角度来看，只要你能将这份额外的披萨卖出去，价格超过了它的边际成本，你就会想要制作这份披萨。如果你已经从之前的披萨中覆盖了你的固定成本，那么每个超过边际成本的分钱都是利润。从社会角度来看，边际成本也很重要。只要顾客愿意支付超过这份披萨的边际成本的费用，每个人都有可能受益——你会得到一个额外的贡献用于支付你的固定成本或者获得利润，而你的顾客可以吃到他们想要的披萨（重要提示：我之所以说“可能获益”是有原因的，因为有时人们想要的东西可能并不是对他们有好处，比如一个患有肥胖症的人想吃一份披萨）。 Now let’s consider what happens as marginal cost falls from a high level. Imagine that your key ingredient was an exceedingly expensive truffle which meant that the marginal cost of each of your pizzas is $1,000. You clearly wouldn’t sell many pizzas, so you might decide to switch to cheaper ingredients and reduce your marginal cost to a point where a larger number of customers are willing to pay more than your marginal cost, so your sales increase. And as you bring down the marginal cost further through additional process and product improvements, you would start to sell even more pizzas. 现在让我们考虑一下，当边际成本从高水平下降时会发生什么。假设你的主要成分是极其昂贵的松露，这意味着每个比萨饼的边际成本为1,000美元。显然，你不会卖出很多比萨饼，因此你可能会决定换成更便宜的原料，将边际成本降低到更多的客户愿意支付高于你的边际成本的点，因此你的销售额会增加。当你通过额外的过程和产品改进进一步降低边际成本时，你将开始销售更多的比萨饼。 Now imagine that through a magical new invention you could make additional tasty pizzas at close to zero marginal cost (say one cent per additional pizza) and ship them instantaneously to anywhere in the world. You would then be able to sell an exceedingly large number of pizzas. If you charged just two cents per pizza, you would be making one cent of profit for every additional pizza you sold. At such low marginal cost you would probably quickly gain a monopoly on the global pizza market (more on this later). Anyone in the world who was hungry and could afford at least one cent might buy one of your pizzas. The best price of your pizza from a societal point of view would be one cent (your marginal cost): the hungry would be fed, and you would cover your marginal cost. But as a monopolist that is unlikely what you would do. Instead, you would probably engage in all sorts of problematic behavior aimed at increased profits, such as charging more than marginal cost, trying to prevent competitors from entering the market, and even looking to get people addicted to pizza so they will consume ever more. 现在想象一下，通过一个神奇的新发明，你可以以接近零的边际成本（比如每个额外的比萨饼一分钱）制作额外美味的比萨饼，并立即运往世界任何地方。你将能够销售极大量的比萨饼。如果你每个比萨饼只收两分钱，那么你每卖出一个比萨饼就会赚一分钱的利润。在如此低的边际成本下，你可能很快就会在全球比萨饼市场上垄断（稍后再详细讨论）。世界上任何一个饥饿的人只要负担得起至少一分钱就能买到你的比萨饼。从社会角度来看，你的比萨饼的最佳价格应该是一分钱（即边际成本）：饥饿者会得到食物，而你也能够覆盖边际成本。但作为垄断者，这不太可能会这样做的。相反，你可能会参与各种问题行为，旨在增加利润，例如收取超过边际成本的费用，试图阻止竞争者进入市场，甚至寻求让人们对比萨饼上瘾，以便有消费更多。 This is exactly where we currently are with digital technology. We can “feed the world” with information: that additional YouTube video view, additional access to Wikipedia, or additional traffic report from Waze all have zero marginal cost. And just as in the case of the hypothetical zero marginal cost pizza we are seeing the emergence of digital monopolies, along with all the problems that entails (see Part Four on ‘Informational Freedom’ for a proposed remedy). 正是数字技术当前所处的情况。我们可以用信息“喂饱”全世界：额外的YouTube视频观看、额外的Wikipedia访问或额外的Waze交通报告的成本都是零。正如在假想的零边际成本比萨的情况下一样，我们正在看到数字垄断的出现，以及随之而来的所有问题（有关“信息自由”的第四部分提出了一种解决方案）。 We are not used to zero marginal cost: most of our existing economics depends on the assumption that marginal costs are greater than zero. You can think of zero marginal cost as an economic singularity similar to dividing by zero in math—as you approach it, strange things begin to happen. In addition to digital near-monopolies we are already observing power-law distributions of income and wealth (see Part Three), where small variations result in hugely different outcomes. Furthermore, we are now rapidly approaching this zero marginal cost singularity in many other industries, which are primarily information based, including finance and education. In summary, the first characteristic of digital technology that dramatically expands the space of the possible is zero marginal cost. This can result in digital monopolies, but also has the potential to grant all of humanity access to the world’s knowledge. 我们不习惯边际成本为零：我们现有的大多数经济学都依赖于边际成本大于零的假设。你可以把零边际成本看作是一个经济奇点，类似于数学中的除以零--当你接近它时，奇怪的事情开始发生。除了数字近乎垄断，我们已经观察到收入和财富的幂律分布（见第三部分），其中微小的变化导致了巨大的不同结果。此外，在许多其他主要基于信息的行业，包括金融和教育，我们现在正迅速接近这个零边际成本的奇点。总而言之，数字技术的第一个特点是零边际成本，它极大地扩展了可能的空间。这可能导致数字垄断，但也有可能让全人类获得世界的知识。 Universality of Computation 计算的普遍性 Zero marginal cost is only one property of digital technology that dramatically expands the space of the possible; the second is in some ways even more amazing. 零边际成本只是数字技术的一个属性，它极大地扩展了可能的空间；第二个属性在某些方面甚至更令人惊讶。 Computers are universal machines. I use this term in a precise sense: anything that can be computed in the universe can in principle be computed by the kind of machine that we already have, given enough memory and time. We have known this since Alan Turing’s groundbreaking work on computation in the middle of the last century. He invented an abstract version of a computer that we now call a Turing machine, before coming up with a proof to show that this simple machine could compute anything (Mullins, 2012; “Church–Turing thesis,” 2020). 计算机是通用机器。我在精确的意义上使用这个术语：只要有足够的内存和时间，宇宙中任何可以计算的东西原则上都可以由我们已有的那种机器计算出来。自从阿兰-图灵在上个世纪中叶对计算的开创性工作以来，我们就知道这一点。他发明了一个抽象版的计算机，我们现在称之为图灵机，然后提出了一个证明，表明这个简单的机器可以计算任何东西(Mullins, 2012; \"Church-Turing thesis,\" 2020)。 By “computation,” I mean any process that takes information inputs, executes a series of processing steps, and produces information outputs. That is—for better or worse—also much of what a human brain does: it receives inputs via nerves, carries out some internal processing and produces outputs. In principle, a digital machine can accomplish every computation that a human brain can. Those brain computations include something as simple and everyday as recognizing someone’s face (inputs: image, output: name) to something as complicated as diagnosing disease (inputs: symptoms and test results, output: differential diagnosis). 我所说的 \"计算 \"是指任何接受信息输入，执行一系列处理步骤，并产生信息输出的过程。无论好坏，这也是人脑所做的大部分工作：它通过神经接收输入，进行一些内部处理并产生输出。原则上，数字机器可以完成人脑可以完成的每一个计算。这些大脑计算包括像识别某人的脸一样简单和日常的东西（输入：图像，输出：名字），以及像诊断疾病一样复杂的东西（输入：症状和测试结果，输出：鉴别诊断）。 This ‘in principle’ limitation will turn out to be significant only if quantum effects matter for the functioning of the brain, meaning effects that require quantum phenomena such as entanglement and the superposition of states. This is a hotly debated topic (Jedlicka, 2017). Quantum effects do not change what can be computed in principle, as even a Turing machine can theoretically simulate a quantum effect—but it would take an impractically long time, potentially millions of years, to do so (Timpson, 2004). If quantum effects are important in the brain, we may need further progress in quantum computing to replicate some of the brain’s computational capabilities. However, I believe that quantum effects are unlikely to matter for the bulk of computations carried out by the human brain—that is, if they matter at all. We may, of course, one day discover something new about physical reality that will change our view of what is computable, but so far this hasn’t happened. 只有当量子效应对大脑的运作很重要时，这种 \"原则上 \"的限制才会变得重要，这意味着需要量子现象的影响，如纠缠和状态的叠加。这是一个争论激烈的话题（Jedlicka，2017）。量子效应并没有改变原则上可以计算的东西，因为即使是图灵机在理论上也可以模拟量子效应--但这需要不切实际的漫长时间，可能是数百万年才能做到（Timpson, 2004）。如果量子效应在大脑中很重要，我们可能需要在量子计算方面取得进一步的进展来复制大脑的一些计算能力。然而，我相信量子效应不太可能对人脑进行的大部分计算有影响，也就是说，如果它们真的有影响的话。当然，我们可能有一天会发现一些关于物理现实的新东西，从而改变我们对什么是可计算的看法，但到目前为止这还没有发生。 For a long time, this property of universality didn’t matter much because computers were pretty dumb compared to humans. This was frustrating to computer scientists who since Turing had believed that it should be possible to build an intelligent machine, but for decades couldn’t get it to work. Even something that humans find really simple, such as recognizing faces, had computers stumped. Now, however, we have computers that can recognize faces, and their performance at doing so is improving rapidly. 在很长一段时间里，这种普遍性的属性并不重要，因为与人类相比，计算机是非常愚蠢的。这让计算机科学家们感到沮丧，他们从图灵开始就相信应该有可能制造出一台智能机器，但几十年来却无法让它发挥作用。即使是人类认为非常简单的事情，如识别人脸，也让计算机陷入了困境。然而，现在，我们有了能够识别人脸的计算机，而且它们在这方面的性能正在迅速提高。 An analogy here is the human discovery of heavier-than-air flight. We knew for a long time that it must be possible—after all, birds are heavier than air and they can fly—but it took until 1903, when the Wright brothers built the first successful airplane, for us to figure out how to do it (“Wright Brothers,” 2020). Once they and several other people had figured it out, progress was rapid—we went from not knowing how to fly to crossing the Atlantic in passenger jet planes in fifty-five years: the British Overseas Airways Corporation’s first transatlantic jet passenger flight was in 1958 (“British Overseas Airways Corporation,” 2020). If you plot this on a graph, you see a perfect example of a non-linearity. We didn’t get gradually better at flying—we couldn’t do it at all, and then suddenly we could do it very well. 这里的一个比喻是人类发现了比空气重的飞行。我们很早就知道这一定是可能的--毕竟鸟类比空气重，它们可以飞行--但直到1903年莱特兄弟制造出第一架成功的飞机，我们才知道如何做到这一点（\"莱特兄弟\"，2020）。一旦他们和其他几个人想通了，进展就很快了--我们在55年内从不知道如何飞行到乘坐喷气式客机穿越大西洋：英国海外航空公司的第一次跨大西洋喷气式客机飞行是在1958年（\"英国海外航空公司\"，2020年）。如果你在图表上绘制这个，你会看到一个完美的非线性例子。我们并没有在飞行方面逐渐变得更好--我们根本无法做到这一点，然后突然我们可以做得很好。 ​​ Non-Commercial Flight Distance Records 非商业飞行距离记录 Digital technology is similar. A series of breakthroughs have taken us from having essentially no machine intelligence to a situation where machines can outperform humans on many different tasks, including reading handwriting and recognizing faces (Neuroscience News, 2018; Phillips et al., 2018). The rate of machines’ progress in learning how to drive cars is another great example of the non-linearity of improvement. The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) held its first so-called “Grand Challenge” for self-driving cars in 2004. At the time they picked a 150-mile-long closed course in the Mojave Desert, and no car got further than seven miles (less than 5 per cent of the course) before getting stuck. By 2012, less than a decade later, Google’s self-driving cars had driven over 300,000 miles on public roads, with traffic (Urmson, 2012). 数字技术也是如此。一系列的突破使我们从基本上没有机器智能的状态，到现在机器能在许多不同的任务上超越人类，包括识别手写和人脸（Neuroscience News，2018；Phillips等，2018）。机器学习驾驶汽车的进展速度也是非线性改善的另一个很好的例子。国防高级研究计划局（DARPA）于2004年举行了第一次所谓的自动驾驶汽车“大挑战”。当时他们选择了一个位于莫哈维沙漠的150英里长的封闭赛道，但没有一辆汽车能在赛道上行驶超过7英里（不到赛道长度的5％）就卡住了。而到了不到10年后的2012年，谷歌的自动驾驶汽车已经在公共道路上行驶了超过30万英里，还要面对交通（Urmson，2012）。 Some people may object that reading handwriting, recognizing faces, or driving a car is not what we mean by ‘intelligence’, but this just points out that we don’t have a good definition of it. After all, if you had a pet dog that could perform any of these tasks, let alone all three, you would call it an ‘intelligent’ dog. 有些人可能会反对说，识别手写字、识别人脸或开车并不是我们所谓的“智能”，但这只是指出我们没有一个好的定义。毕竟，如果你有一只能够执行这些任务中的任何一项，甚至全部三项的宠物狗，你会称它为“聪明”的狗。 Other people point out that humans also have creativity and that these machines won’t be creative even if we grant them some form of intelligence. However, this amounts to arguing that creativity is something other than computation. The word implies ‘something from nothing’ and outputs without inputs, but that is not the nature of human creativity. After all, musicians create new music after hearing lots of music, engineers create new machines after seeing existing ones, and so on. 其他人指出，人类也具有创造力，即使我们赋予这些机器某种形式的智能，它们也不会具有创造力。然而，这相当于认为创造力与计算不同。这个词意味着“从无到有”的东西，没有输入就有输出，但这不是人类创造力的本质。毕竟，音乐家在听了很多音乐后创作新的音乐，工程师在看到现有机器后创造新的机器，等等。 There is now evidence that at least some types of creativity can be recreated simply through computation. In 2016, Google achieved a breakthrough in machine intelligence when their AlphaGo program beat the South Korean Go grandmaster Lee Sedol by four games to one (Borowiec, 2017). Until that point, progress with game-playing software had been comparatively slow and the best programs were unable to beat strong club players, let alone grandmasters. The number of possible plays in Go is extremely large, far exceeding chess. This means that searching through possible moves and counter-moves from a current position, which is the approach historically used by chess computers, cannot be used in Go—instead, candidate moves need to be conjectured. Put differently, playing Go involves creativity. 在某些情况下，有证据表明某些类型的创造力可以简单地通过计算机来重新创造。2016年，谷歌在机器智能领域取得了突破性进展，他们的AlphaGo程序以4比1击败了韩国围棋大师李世石（Borowiec，2017）。在那之前，博弈竞争的进展相对缓慢，最好的程序无法击败强大的俱乐部选手，更不用说大师了。围棋中可能出现的棋局数量非常庞大，远远超过国际象棋。这意味着无法像历史上的国际象棋计算机一样通过搜索当前位置的可能移动和反移动来玩围棋，而是需要猜测候选移动。换句话说，下围棋涉及到创造力。 The approach used for the AlphaGo program started out by training a neural network on games previously played by humans. Once the network was good enough, it was improved further by playing against itself. There has already been progress in the application of these and related techniques, which are often referred to as ‘generative adversarial networks’ (GANs) to the composition of music and the creation of designs. Even more surprisingly, it has been shown that machines can learn to be creative not just by studying prior human games or designs, but by creating their own, based on rules. Each of AlphaGo’s two successors, AlphaGo Zero and AlphaZero, started out knowing only the rules and learned from playing games against itself (“AlphaZero,” 2020). This approach will allow machines to be creative in areas where there is limited or no prior human progress. 这个AlphaGo程序使用的方法是，首先让神经网络对人类先前下过的棋局进行训练。一旦网络足够好，它就通过自我对弈进一步提高。这些相关技术的应用已经取得了进展，这些技术通常被称为“生成对抗网络”（GAN），用于音乐作曲和设计创作。更令人惊讶的是，已经证明机器可以通过创造自己的规则来学习创造性，而不仅仅是通过研究之前的人类游戏或设计。AlphaGo的两个后继程序AlphaGo Zero和AlphaZero从只知道规则开始，通过自我对弈学习（“AlphaZero”，2020）。这种方法将使机器在人类进展有限或没有进展的领域具备创造性。 While much of what the brain does is computation, including many tasks that we identify as creative, there is one function of the brain that may never be accessible to digital machines: having ‘qualia.’ This is a term from philosophy which refers to our subjective experience, such as what it “feels like” to be cold (or hot), to touch an object, be stressed or amazed. For example, when a digital thermostat displays the room temperature we do not assume that its internal state has anything remotely resembling our own subjective sensation. The lack of qualia is obvious in this example, but we assume that it extends to much more complex situations, such as a self-driving car taking a series of turns on a winding highway. We would expect a human driver to experience a sensation of thrill or elation, but not the car. This lack of qualia in machines may seem like an aside for the moment, but will turn out to be an important component of where humans might direct their attention in the Knowledge Age. 虽然大脑所做的大部分工作都是计算，包括许多被我们认定为创造性的任务，但大脑的一个功能可能永远无法被数字机器所获取：拥有 \"质感\"。这是一个来自哲学的术语，指的是我们的主观体验，比如冷（或热）的 \"感觉\"，触摸一个物体的感觉，压力或惊奇的感觉。例如，当数字恒温器显示室温时，我们不会认为其内部状态与我们自己的主观感觉有任何相似之处。在这个例子中，缺乏质感是显而易见的，但我们假设它延伸到更复杂的情况，比如一辆自动驾驶汽车在蜿蜒的高速公路上进行一系列的转弯。我们希望人类司机能体验到刺激或兴奋的感觉，但汽车不会。机器中缺乏质感这一点目前看来似乎是个题外话，但在信息时代，它将成为人类可能将注意力引向何处的一个重要组成部分。 Universality at Zero Marginal Cost 在零边际成本下的普遍性 As impressive as zero marginal cost and universality are on their own, in combination they are truly magical. To take one example, we are making good progress in the development of a computer program that will be able to diagnose disease from a patient’s symptoms in a series of steps, including ordering tests and interpreting their results (Parkin, 2020). Though we might have expected this to happen at some point based on the principle of universality, we are making tangible progress and should accomplish this in a matter of decades, if not sooner. At that point, thanks to zero marginal cost, we will be able to provide low-cost diagnosis to anyone in the world. Let that sink in slowly: free medical diagnosis for all humans will soon be in the space of the possible. 虽然零边际成本和通用性本身已经非常令人印象深刻，但是将它们结合起来真的是魔幻的。以一个例子来说明，我们正在取得良好的进展，开发一种计算机程序，能够通过一系列步骤，包括订购检测和解释结果，从患者的症状中诊断疾病（Parkin，2020）。虽然我们可能基于通用性原则预计这种情况在某个时候会发生，但我们正在取得实质性进展，要不了多长时间，我们能够在数十年内实现这一目标。到那时，由于零边际成本，我们将能够为全世界任何人提供低成本的诊断。让这一点缓慢地沉淀下来：免费的医学诊断对于全人类来说很快将成为可能。 The universality of computation at zero marginal cost is unlike anything we have had with prior technologies. Being able to make all the world’s information and knowledge accessible to all of humanity was never before possible, nor were intelligent machines. Now we have both. This represents at least as dramatic and non-linear an increase the ‘space of the possible’ for humanity as agriculture and industry did before, and each of those developments ushered in an entirely different age. We will be able to think better about what this implies for the current transition and the next age if we first put some foundations in place. 以零边际成本进行计算的普遍性是我们以前的技术所不具备的。能够让全人类获得世界上所有的信息和知识在以前是不可能的，智能机器也是不可能的。现在我们两者都有了。这至少代表了人类 \"可能空间 \"的戏剧性和非线性增长，就像以前的农业和工业一样，而这些发展都迎来了一个完全不同的时代。如果我们首先建立一些基础，我们将能够更好地思考这对当前的过渡和下一个时代意味着什么。 "},"docs/Part_One_Laying_a_Foundation.html":{"url":"docs/Part_One_Laying_a_Foundation.html","title":"第一部分：打下基础","keywords":"","body":"第一部分：打下基础 With digital technology so fundamentally expanding what we are able to do, we must establish some basic principles if we are to avoid misinterpreting current trends and phenomena. These principles will allow us to truly explore this new ‘space of the possible’ and the benefits that it might bring, instead of limiting and bending the technology to fit our existing economic and social systems. 由于数字技术从根本上扩大了我们能够做的事情，如果我们要避免误解当前的趋势和现象，我们必须建立一些基本原则。这些原则将使我们能够真正探索这个新的 \"可能空间 \"和它可能带来的好处，与其限制和强行适应技术以适应我们现有的经济和社会系统，不如相反地让技术自由发展。 What follows is an attempt to establish a firm foundation for how we might build a future, grounding it in a clear set of values. I start with a brief definition of knowledge, a term I use extensively and in a way that is somewhat different from common usage. I then explain the relationship between optimism and knowledge, as well as the importance of choices in shaping our future. This is followed by a discussion of why the existence of knowledge provides an objective basis for humanism, which sets it apart from other religious and philosophical narratives. Much of my thinking in this area has been influenced by the writing of David Deutsch, and in particular his book The Beginning of Infinity, which explores the history, philosophy and power of explanations (Deutsch, 2011). 下面的内容是试图为我们如何建立一个未来建立一个坚实的基础，把它建立在一套明确的价值观上。我首先对知识进行了简单的定义，我广泛地使用了这个术语，而且使用的方式与通常的用法有些不同。然后我解释了乐观主义和知识之间的关系，以及选择对塑造我们的未来的重要性。接下来，我将讨论为什么知识的存在为人文主义提供了一个客观的基础，从而使其有别于其他宗教和哲学的叙述。我在这一领域的大部分思考都受到了大卫-多伊奇（David Deutsch）著作的影响，特别是他的《无限的开始》（The Beginning of Infinity）一书，该书探讨了解释的历史、哲学和力量（Deutsch, 2011）。 I will then provide a definition of scarcity based directly on human needs rather than on money and prices, using this definition to show how technology has shifted scarcity throughout history, leading to dramatic changes in how we live. From there, I lay out a plan of attack for the rest of the book. 我将直接从人类需求出发提供稀缺性的定义，而非从货币和价格出发，利用这个定义来展示技术如何在历史上改变了稀缺性，从而导致我们生活方式的巨大变化。然后，我将为本书的余下部分提出攻略计划。 ‍ "},"docs/Part_One_Laying_a_Foundation/Knowledge.html":{"url":"docs/Part_One_Laying_a_Foundation/Knowledge.html","title":"知识","keywords":"","body":"知识 Knowledge, as I use this term, is the information that humanity has recorded in a medium and improved over time. There are two crucial parts to this definition. The first is “recorded in a medium,” which allows information to be shared across time and space. The second is “improved over time,” which separates knowledge from mere information. 知识，正如我所使用的这个术语，是人类用一种媒介记录下来并随着时间的推移而改进的信息。这个定义有两个关键部分。第一部分是 \"记录在媒介中\"，这使得信息可以跨越时间和空间进行共享。第二是 \"随着时间的推移而改进\"，它将知识与单纯的信息分开。 A conversation that I had years ago but didn’t record cannot be knowledge in my sense—it isn’t accessible to anyone who wasn’t there when it happened, and even my own recollection of it will fade. However, if I write down an insight from that conversation and publish it on my blog, I have potentially contributed to human knowledge. The blog post is available to others across space and time, and some blog posts will turn out to be important contributions to human knowledge. As another example, the DNA in our cells isn’t knowledge by my definition, whereas a recorded genome sequence can be maintained, shared and analyzed. Gene sequences that turn out to be medically significant, such as the BRCA mutation that increases the risk of breast cancer, become part of human knowledge. 很多年前我曾经有过一次对话，但我没有记录下来，这在我的定义下不属于知识——对于那些当时没有在场的人来说，它是无法获取的，而且即使是我自己回忆起来，也会渐渐消逝。然而，如果我将从那次对话中得出的见解写下来并发表在我的博客上，那么我就有可能为人类知识做出贡献。这篇博客文章可以在时空中传播给其他人，其中一些文章最终可能成为人类知识的重要贡献。再举一个例子，我们细胞中的DNA在我的定义下不属于知识，而记录下来的基因组序列则可以被维护、分享和分析。那些最终证明在医学上有重要意义的基因序列，例如增加乳腺癌风险的BRCA突变，成为了人类知识的一部分。 My definition of knowledge is intentionally broad, and includes not just technical and scientific knowledge but art, music and literature. But it excludes anything that is either ephemeral or not subject to improvement. Modern computers, for example, produce tons of recorded information that are not subsequently analyzed or integrated into any process of progressive bettering. The reasons for this definition of knowledge will become clear as I use the term in the following sections and throughout the book. 我对知识的定义有意放宽，不仅包括技术和科学知识，还包括艺术、音乐和文学。但它不包括任何短暂的或不能改进的东西。例如，现代计算机产生了大量的记录信息，而这些信息随后并没有被分析或整合到任何渐进式的改进过程中。这个知识定义的原因将在我在以下章节和全书中使用这个术语时变得清晰。 ‍ "},"docs/Part_One_Laying_a_Foundation/Optimism.html":{"url":"docs/Part_One_Laying_a_Foundation/Optimism.html","title":"乐观","keywords":"","body":"乐观 When I started my blog over a decade ago, I called myself a “technology optimist.“ I wrote: 当我在十多年前开始写博客时，我称自己是一个 \"技术乐观主义者\"。我写道： I am excited to be living [at] a time when we are making tremendous progress on understanding aging, fighting cancer, developing clean technologies and so much more. This is not to say that I automatically assume that technology by itself will solve all our problems […]. Instead, I believe that – over time – we as a society figure out how to use technology to […] improve our standard of living. I for one am […] glad I am not living in the Middle Ages. 我很高兴生活在这样一个时代，我们在理解衰老、抗击癌症、开发清洁技术和许多其他方面正在取得巨大的进展。这并不是说我自动假设技术本身会解决我们所有的问题[...]。相反，我相信--随着时间的推移--我们这个社会会找出如何利用技术来[...]提高我们的生活水平。我很高兴我没有生活在中世纪。 This book is fundamentally optimistic, which is partly a reflection of my personality. I can’t see how it would be possible to be a venture capitalist as a pessimist. You would find yourself focusing on the reasons why a particular startup would be unlikely to succeed and as a result would never make an investment. 这本书从根本上说是乐观的，这部分地反映了我的个性。我看不出作为一个悲观主义者怎么可能成为一个风险投资家。你会发现自己专注于某家创业公司不可能成功的原因，因此永远不会进行投资。 I want to be clear about this apparent bias from the start. Optimism, however, is much more than a personal bias—it is essential for human knowledge. Acts of knowledge creation, such as inventing a new technology or writing a new song, are profoundly optimistic. They assume that problems can be solved, and that art will impact the audience (which is true even for a pessimistic song). Optimism is the attitude that progress is possible. 我想从一开始就清楚地说明这种明显的偏见。然而，乐观不仅仅是一种个人偏见--它对人类知识来说是必不可少的。知识创造的行为，如发明一项新技术或写一首新歌，是深刻的乐观主义。他们假设问题可以被解决，艺术会影响观众（即使是悲观的歌曲也是如此）。乐观主义是一种态度，认为进步是可能的。 Progress has become a loaded term. After all, despite our technological achievements, aren’t humans also responsible for the many diseases of civilization, for the extinction of countless species, and potentially for our own demise through climate change? Without a doubt we have caused tremendous suffering throughout human history, and we are currently faced with huge problems including a global pandemic and the ongoing climate crisis. But what is the alternative to trying to tackle these? 进步已经成为一个有价值的术语。毕竟，尽管我们取得了技术上的成就，但人类不是也要为文明的许多疾病、无数物种的灭绝以及可能因气候变化而导致我们自己的灭亡负责吗？毫无疑问，我们在整个人类历史上造成了巨大的痛苦，而且我们目前面临着巨大的问题，包括全球大流行病和正在发生的气候危机。但是，除了试图解决这些问题之外，还有什么选择呢？ The beauty of problems is that knowledge can help us overcome them. Consider the problem of warming ourselves in the cold. Humans invented ways of making fire, eventually documented them, and have since dramatically improved the ways in which we can produce heat. We may take the existence of knowledge for granted, but no other species has it, which means whether they can solve a problem depends largely on luck and circumstance. So not only is optimism essential for knowledge, but the existence of knowledge is the basis for optimism. 问题的魅力在于，知识可以帮助我们克服它们。考虑一下在寒冷中取暖的问题。人类发明了生火的方法，并最终将其记录下来，此后又极大地改进了我们产生热量的方式。我们可能认为知识的存在是理所当然的，但没有其他物种拥有这些知识，这意味着他们是否能解决一个问题主要取决于运气和环境。因此，不仅是乐观主义对知识至关重要，而且知识的存在也是乐观主义的基础。 There is an extreme position that suggests that we would have been better off if we had never developed knowledge in the first place (Ablow, 2015). While this may sound absurd, much of religious eschatology (theology about the ‘end times’) and apocalyptic thinking is associated with this position, asserting that a grand reckoning for the sins of progress is inevitable. And while they are rare, there have even been voices welcoming the COVID-19 pandemic and the climate crisis as harbingers, if not of apocalypse, then at least of a “Great Reset.” Although there is no guarantee that all future problems will be solvable through knowledge, one thing is certain: assuming that problems cannot be solved guarantees that they will not be. Pessimism is self-defeating, and apocalyptic beliefs are self-fulfilling. 有一种极端的立场认为，如果我们一开始就不发展知识，我们会过得更好（Ablow，2015）。虽然这听起来很荒谬，但许多宗教末世论（关于 \"末世 \"的神学）和世界末日思想都与这一立场有关，断言对进步的罪孽进行大清算是不可避免的。虽然这种说法很罕见，但甚至有声音欢迎COVID-19大流行病和气候危机的预兆，如果不是启示录，至少也是 \"大重置 \"的预兆。虽然不能保证所有的未来问题都可以通过知识来解决，但有一点是肯定的：假设问题不能被解决，就会保证问题不能被解决。悲观主义是自取灭亡的，而世界末日的信念是自我实现的。 All of this is also true for digital technology, which has already brought with it a new set of problems. We will encounter many of them in this book, including the huge incentives for companies such as Facebook to capture as much attention as possible, and the conflicts that arise from exposure to content that runs counter to one’s cultural or religious beliefs. And yet digital technology also enables amazing progress, such as the potential for the diagnosis of diseases at zero marginal cost. The World After Capital is optimistic that we can solve not only the problems of digital technology, but also that we can apply digital technology in a way that results in broad progress, including the knowledge creation needed to address the climate crisis. 所有这些对于数字技术来说也是如此，它已经带来了一系列新的问题。我们将在本书中遇到许多这样的问题，包括对Facebook等公司的巨大激励，以尽可能多地捕获注意力，以及因接触到与个人文化或宗教信仰相悖的内容而产生的冲突。然而，数字技术也促成了惊人的进步，例如以零边际成本诊断疾病的潜力。《资本后的世界》乐观地认为，我们不仅可以解决数字技术的问题，而且还可以以一种导致广泛进步的方式应用数字技术，包括解决气候危机所需的知识创造。 "},"docs/Part_One_Laying_a_Foundation/Choices.html":{"url":"docs/Part_One_Laying_a_Foundation/Choices.html","title":"选择","keywords":"","body":"选择 Believing in the potential of progress does not mean being a Pollyanna, and it is important to remember that progress is not the inevitable result of technology. Contrary to the claims made by the technology writer Kevin Kelly in his book What Technology Wants, technology doesn’t want a better world for humanity; it simply makes such a world possible. 相信进步的潜力并不意味着成为一个波利安娜，重要的是要记住，进步不是技术的必然结果。与技术作家凯文-凯利在其《技术想要什么》一书中的说法相反，技术并不希望人类有一个更好的世界；它只是让这样的世界成为可能。 Nor does economics ‘want’ anything: nothing in economic theory, for instance, says that a new technology cannot make people worse off. Economics gives us tools that we can use to analyze markets and design regulations to address their failures, but we still need to make choices relating to what we want markets and regulations to accomplish. 经济学也没有 \"想要 \"什么：例如，经济理论中没有任何内容说一项新技术不能让人们的生活变得更糟。经济学为我们提供了工具，我们可以用来分析市场，并设计法规来解决市场的失败，但我们仍然需要对我们希望市场和法规实现的目标做出选择。 Moreover, contrary to what Karl Marx thought, history also doesn’t ‘want’ anything. There isn’t a deterministic mechanism through which conflicts between labor and capital are ultimately bound to be resolved in favor of a classless society. Nor is there, as the political economist Francis Fukuyama would have it, an “end of history“—a final social, economic and political system. History doesn’t make its own choices, it is the result of human choices, and there will be new choices to make, as long as we continue to make technological progress. 此外，与卡尔-马克思的想法相反，历史也不'想要'什么。并不存在一个决定性的机制，通过这个机制，劳动和资本之间的冲突最终一定会被解决，以有利于一个无阶级的社会。也没有像政治经济学家弗朗西斯-福山（Francis Fukuyama）所说的那样，有一个 \"历史的终结\"--一个最终的社会、经济和政治制度。历史不会做出自己的选择，它是人类选择的结果，而且只要我们继续取得技术进步，就会有新的选择。 It always has been our responsibility to make choices about which of the worlds made possible by new technology we want to live in. Some of these choices need to be made collectively (requiring rules or regulations), and some of them need to be made individually (requiring self-regulation). The choices we are faced with today are especially important because digital technology so dramatically increases the ‘space of the possible’ that it includes the potential for machines that possess knowledge and will eventually want to make choices of their own. 我们一直有责任对新技术所带来的世界中哪些是我们想要生活的做出选择。其中有些选择需要集体做出（需要规则或条例），有些则需要个人做出（需要自律）。我们今天面临的选择尤其重要，因为数字技术极大地增加了 \"可能的空间\"，它包括拥有知识的机器的潜力，并最终想要做出自己的选择。 Regulation 监管 The people building or funding digital technology tend to be optimists and to believe in progress (though there are also opportunists thrown into the mix). Many of those optimists also believe in the need for regulation, while another group has a decidedly libertarian streak and would prefer governments not to be involved. For them, regulation and progress conflict. The debates between these two groups are often acrimonious, which is unfortunate, because the history of technology clearly demonstrates both the benefits of good regulation and the dangers of bad regulation. Our energy is thus better spent on figuring out the right kind of regulation, as well as engaging in the processes required to enforce and revise it. 建设或资助数字技术的人往往是乐观主义者，相信进步（尽管也有机会主义者加入其中）。这些乐观主义者中的许多人也相信需要监管，而另一个群体则有明显的自由主义倾向，希望政府不要介入。对他们来说，监管和进步是冲突的。这两类人之间的争论往往是尖锐的，这很不幸，因为技术的历史清楚地表明了良好监管的好处和不良监管的危险。因此，我们的精力最好花在找出正确的监管方式上，以及参与执行和修订监管所需的过程。 The history of regulating automotive technology is instructive here. Much of the world currently gets around by driving cars. The car was an important technological innovation because it vastly enhanced individual mobility, but its widespread adoption and large scale impacts would have been impossible without legislation, including massive public investments. We needed to build roads and to agree on how they should be used, neither of which could have been accomplished based solely on individual choices. Roads are an example of a ‘natural monopoly.’ Multiple disjointed road networks or different sets of rules would be hugely problematic: imagine what would happen if some people drove on the left side of the road and others drove on the right. Natural monopolies are situations where markets fail and regulation is required, and social norms are another form of regulation. The car would have been less widely adopted as a mode of individual transport without changes in social norms that made it acceptable for women to drive, for instance. 监管汽车技术的历史在这里很有启发。目前世界上大部分人都是通过驾驶汽车出行的。汽车是一项重要的技术革新，因为它极大地提高了个人的流动性，但如果没有立法，包括大规模的公共投资，它的广泛采用和大规模的影响是不可能的。我们需要建造道路，并就如何使用这些道路达成一致，而这两点仅靠个人选择是不可能实现的。道路是一个 \"自然垄断 \"的例子。多个脱节的道路网络或不同的规则将产生巨大的问题：想象一下，如果一些人在道路的左边开车，而另一些人在右边开车，会发生什么。自然垄断是市场失效和需要监管的情况，而社会规范是另一种形式的监管。例如，如果没有让女性开车成为社会规范的变化，汽车作为个人交通工具的普及度就会降低。 Not all regulation is good, of course. In fact, the earliest regulation of automotive vehicles was aimed at delaying their adoption by limiting them to walking speed. In the United Kingdom they were even required by law in their early years to be preceded by someone on foot carrying a red flag (“Red Flag Traffic Laws,” 2020). Similarly, not all regulation of digital technology will be beneficial. Much of it will initially aim to protect the status quo and to help established enterprises, including the new incumbents. The recent changes to net neutrality rules are a good example of this (Kang, 2017). 当然，并非所有的监管都是好的。事实上，最早对汽车的监管是为了延迟汽车的采用，将其限制在步行速度。在英国，早年的法律甚至要求它们必须由手持红旗的步行者先行（\"红旗交通法\"，2020）。同样地，并非所有的数字技术监管都是有益的。大部分监管最初都是为了保护现状，帮助既有企业，包括新的在位企业。最近对网络中立性规则的修改就是一个很好的例子（Kang, 2017）。 My proposals for regulation, which I will present later in the book, are aimed at encouraging innovation by giving individuals more economic freedom and better access to information. These regulations, which are choices we need to make collectively, represent a big departure from the status quo and from the programs of the established parties here in the United States and in most other countries. They aim to let us explore the space of the possible that digital technologies have created, so we can transition from the Industrial Age to the Knowledge Age. 我在书中稍后提出的监管建议，旨在通过给予个人更多的经济自由和更好的信息获取渠道来鼓励创新。这些法规是我们需要集体做出的选择，代表了与美国和大多数其他国家的现状和既定政党的方案的巨大差异。它们旨在让我们探索数字技术所创造的可能空间，以便我们能够从工业时代过渡到信息时代。 Self-Regulation 自我调控 Another set of choices has to do with how we react individually to the massive acceleration of information dissemination and knowledge creation that digital technology makes possible. These are not rules that society can impose, because they relate to our inner mental states: they are changes we need to make for ourselves. For instance, there are many people who feel so offended by content that they encounter on the Internet, from videos on YouTube to comments on Twitter, that they become filled with anxiety, rage, and other painful emotions leading them to withdraw or lash out, furthering polarization and cycles of conflict. Other people become trapped in ‘filter bubbles’ that disseminate algorithmically curated information that only confirms their existing biases, while others spend all their time refreshing their Instagram or Facebook feeds. Even though some regulation can help, as well as more technology, overcoming these problems will require us to change how we react to information. 另一组选择与我们如何对数字技术所带来的信息传播和知识创造的大规模加速作出个人反应有关。这些不是社会可以强加的规则，因为它们与我们内在的精神状态有关：它们是我们需要为自己做出的改变。例如，有许多人对他们在互联网上遇到的内容感到非常反感，从YouTube上的视频到Twitter上的评论，他们充满了焦虑、愤怒和其他痛苦的情绪，导致他们退缩或发泄，进一步加剧了两极化和冲突的循环。另一些人则陷入了 \"奶头乐\"，这些信息传播着经过算法处理的信息，而这些信息只能证实他们现有的偏见，还有一些人把所有时间都花在刷新他们的Instagram或Facebook信息上。即使一些监管可以帮助，以及更多的技术，克服这些问题将需要我们改变我们对信息的反应方式。 Changing our reactions is possible through self-regulation, by which I mean training that enhances our capacity to think critically. From Stoicism in ancient Greece to Eastern religions such as Hinduism and Buddhism, humans have a long tradition of practices designed to manage our immediate emotional responses, enabling us to react to the situations we experience in insightful and responsible ways. These mindfulness practices align with what we have learned more recently about the workings of the human brain and body. If we want to be able to take full advantage of digital technology, we need to figure out how to maintain our powers of critical thinking and creativity in the face of an onslaught of information including deliberate attempts to exploit our weaknesses. 改变我们的反应是可能的，通过自我调节，我指的是增强我们批判性思维能力的训练。从古希腊的斯多儿学派到印度教和佛教等东方宗教，人类有一个长久的传统，这些实践旨在管理我们的情绪反应，使我们能够以富有洞见和负责任的方式应对我们所经历的情境。这些正念实践与我们最近了解到的人类大脑和身体运作的知识相符合。如果我们想要充分利用数字技术，我们需要找出如何在大量信息和故意利用我们弱点的情况下保持我们的批判性思维和创造力。 ‍ "},"docs/Part_One_Laying_a_Foundation/Humanism.html":{"url":"docs/Part_One_Laying_a_Foundation/Humanism.html","title":"人文","keywords":"","body":"人文 What are the values that I am basing all this on, and where do they come from? In his book Sapiens, the historian Yuval Noah Harari claims that all value systems are based on equally valid subjective narratives. He denies that there is an objective basis for humanism to support a privileged position for humanity as a species, but here I will try to convince you that he is wrong (Harari, 2011). For not only is the power of knowledge a source of optimism; its very existence provides the basis for humanism. By “humanism” I mean a system of values that centers on human agency and responsibility rather than on the divine or the supernatural, and that embraces the process of critical inquiry as the central enabler of progress. 这一切是基于哪些价值观，这些价值观又从哪里来？历史学家尤瓦尔·赫拉利在他的书《人类简史》中认为，所有价值体系都基于同样有效的主观叙述。他否认人道主义有客观基础来支持人类作为一个物种的特权地位，但我在这里将试图说服你，他是错误的（Harari，2011年）。因为知识的力量不仅是乐观主义的源泉，它的存在本身就为人道主义提供了基础。我所说的“人道主义”是一个以人类行动和责任为中心，而不是神或超自然力量，并将批判性探究过程视为进步的中心推动力的价值体系。 Knowledge, as I have already defined it, is the externalized information that allows humans to share insights with each other. It includes both scientific and artistic knowledge. Again, we are the only species on Earth that generates this kind of knowledge, with the ability to share it over space and time. I am able to read a book today that someone else wrote a long time ago and in a completely different part of the world. 我已经定义过的知识是外化的信息，它使人类能够彼此分享见解，包括科学和艺术知识。再次强调，我们是地球上唯一一种产生这种知识并有能力在时空上分享的物种。我今天能够阅读一本很久以前在完全不同的世界其他地方某个人写的书。 This matters a great deal, because knowledge enables fundamentally different modes of problem solving and progress. Humans can select and combine knowledge created by other humans, allowing small changes to accrete into large bodies of work over time, which in turn provide the basis for scientific and artistic breakthroughs. Without knowledge, other species have only two methods of sharing things they have learned: communication and evolution. Communication is local and ephemeral, and evolution is extremely slow. As a result, animals and plants routinely encounter problems that they cannot solve, resulting in disease, death and even extinction. Many of these problems today are caused by humans (more on that shortly). 这一点非常重要，因为知识使问题解决和进步的方式发生了根本性的变化。人类可以选择和结合其他人类所创造的知识，使得小的变化随着时间的推移累积成为大量的工作基础，进而为科学和艺术突破提供基础。没有知识，其他物种只有两种共享所学的方法：通信和进化。通信是局部的和短暂的，进化是极其缓慢的。因此，动物和植物经常遇到无法解决的问题，导致疾病、死亡甚至灭绝，当然今天许多问题是由人类引起的（稍后会详细讨论）。 Knowledge has given humanity great power. We can fly in the sky, we can sail the seas, travel fast on land, build large and durable structures, and so on. The power of our knowledge is reshaping the Earth. It often does so in ways that solve one set of problems while creating an entirely new set of problems, not just for humans but for other species. This is why it is crucial that we remember what the story of Spiderman tells us: “With great power comes great responsibility.” It is because of knowledge that humans are responsible for looking after dolphins, rather than the other way round. 知识赋予了人类强大的力量。我们可以在天空中飞翔，航行大海，快速地行驶在陆地上，建造大型坚固的建筑等等。我们知识的力量正在重新塑造着地球。它常常用一种方式解决一组问题，同时又创造了一个全新的问题集，不仅对人类，而且对其他物种都是如此。这就是为什么我们必须记住《蜘蛛侠》故事中告诉我们的：“伴随着强大的力量而来的是巨大的责任。”正是由于知识，人类有责任照顾海豚，而不是相反。 Progress and knowledge are inherently linked through critical inquiry: we can only make progress if we are capable of identifying some ideas as better than others. Critical inquiry is by no means linear—new ideas are not always better than old ones. Sometimes we go off in the wrong direction. Still, given enough time, a sorting takes place. For instance, we no longer believe in the geocentric view of our solar system, and only a tiny fraction of the art that has ever been created is still considered important. While this process may take decades or even centuries, it is blindingly fast compared to biological evolution. 进步和知识通过批判性探究固有地联系在一起：只有我们能够辨别出一些思想比其他思想更好，才能取得进步。批判性探究并不是线性的——新思想并不总是比旧思想更好。有时我们会走错方向。然而，如果给足够的时间，就会进行一次筛选。例如，我们不再相信地心说宇宙观，只有极少量的艺术作品仍被认为是重要的。尽管这个过程可能需要几十年甚至几个世纪的时间，但与生物进化相比，这是异常快速的。 My use of the word “better” implies the existence of universal values. All of these flow from the recognition of the power of human knowledge and the responsibility which directly attaches to that power. And the central value is the process of critical inquiry itself. We must be vigilant in pointing out flaws in existing knowledge and proposing alternatives. After all, imagine how impoverished our music would be if we had banned all new compositions after Beethoven. 我使用“better”一词意味着普遍价值的存在。所有这些都源于对人类知识力量的认识和直接由此产生的责任。而核心价值是批判性探究的过程本身。我们必须警惕地指出现有知识的缺陷并提出替代方案。毕竟，想象一下如果我们在贝多芬之后禁止所有新作曲会使我们的音乐变得多么贫乏。 We should thus seek regulation and self-regulation that supports critical inquiry, in the broad sense of processes that weed out bad ideas and help better ones to propagate. In business this often takes the form of market competition, which is why regulation that supports competitive markets is so important. Individually, critical inquiry requires us to be open to receiving feedback in the face of our deeply rooted tendency toward confirmation bias. In politics and government, critical inquiry is enabled by the democratic process. 因此，我们应该寻求支持批判性探究的规定和自我调节，广义上指的是筛选出不好的想法并帮助更好的想法传播的过程。在商业领域，这通常采取市场竞争的形式，这就是为什么支持竞争市场的规定如此重要。个体层面上，批判性探究需要我们面对根深蒂固的确认偏误倾向时，敞开心扉接受反馈。在政治和政府方面，批判性探究通过民主进程得以实现。 Freedom of speech is not a value in and of itself; rather, it is a crucial enabler of critical inquiry. But we can see how some limits on free speech might flow from the same value. If you can use speech to call for violence against individuals or minority groups, you can also use it to suppress critical inquiry. 言论自由本身并不是一个价值观，而是批判性探究的重要推动因素。但我们可以看到，某些限制言论自由的措施可能来源于同样的价值观。如果你可以利用言论呼吁对个人或少数群体施暴，那么你也可以利用它来压制批判性探究。 Digital technology, including a global information network and the general-purpose computing that is bringing machine intelligence, are dramatically accelerating the rate at which humanity can accumulate and share knowledge. However, these same technologies also allow targeted manipulation and propaganda on a global scale, as well as constant distraction, both of which undermine the evaluation and creation of knowledge. Digital technology thus massively increases the importance of critical inquiry, which is central to knowledge-based humanism. 数字技术，包括全球信息网络和带来机器智能的通用计算，极大地加速了人类积累和分享知识的速度。然而，这些技术也允许全球范围内的有针对性的操纵和宣传，以及持续的分散注意力，这两者都会削弱对知识的评估和创造。因此，数字技术极大地增加了批判性探究的重要性，而批判性探究是知识主义的核心。 Beyond critical inquiry, optimism and responsibility, other humanist values are also rooted in the existence of knowledge. One of these is solidarity. There are nearly 8 billion human beings living on Earth, which exists in an otherwise inhospitable solar system. The big problems that humanity faces, such as infectious diseases and the climate crisis, require our combined efforts and will impact all of us. We thus need to support each other, irrespective of such differences as gender, race or nationality. Whatever our superficial differences may be, we are much more like each other—because of knowledge—than we are to any other species. 除了批判性探究、乐观主义和责任感，其他人文主义价值观也植根于知识的存在。其中之一就是团结。有近80亿人生活在地球上，而地球存在于一个原本荒凉的太阳系中。人类面临的大问题，如传染病和气候危机，需要我们共同努力，并将影响我们所有人。因此，我们需要相互支持，而不考虑性别、种族或国籍等差异。无论我们的外表差异是什么，我们彼此之间的相似性--因为知识--比我们与其他任何物种的相似性要大得多。 Once we have established a shared commitment to the value of solidarity, we can celebrate diversity as another humanist value. In current political debates we often pit individuality against the collective as if it the two conflicted. However, to modernize John Donne, no human is an island—we are all part of societies, and of humanity at large. By recognizing the importance of our common humanity, we create the basis on which we can unfold as individuals. Solidarity allows us to celebrate, rather than fear, the diversity of the human species. 一旦我们建立了对团结价值的共同承诺，我们就可以将多样性作为另一个人道主义价值进行庆祝。在当前的政治辩论中，我们经常将个性与集体对立起来，似乎两者存在冲突。然而，用现代化的约翰·邓恩（John Donne）的话来说，没有人是一座孤岛——我们都是社会和整个人类的一部分。通过认识到我们共同人性的重要性，我们创造了作为个体发展的基础。团结使我们能够庆祝人类物种的多样性，而不是害怕它。 "},"docs/Part_One_Laying_a_Foundation/Scarcity.html":{"url":"docs/Part_One_Laying_a_Foundation/Scarcity.html","title":"稀缺","keywords":"","body":"稀缺 Those with some familiarity with economic theory are likely to understand ‘scarcity’ in its terms. In that context, something is scarce if its price is greater than zero. By this definition, land is scarce—it costs a lot of money to buy a piece of land. And financial capital is still because even with our current low interest rates, there is a price for borrowing money or raising equity. 把经济理论稍微了解一些的人可能会用经济学的术语理解“稀缺”。按照这个定义，如果某物品的价格大于零，则它是稀缺的。按照这个定义，土地是稀缺的——购买一块土地需要花费很多钱。即使在目前低利率的情况下，金融资本仍然是稀缺的，因为借钱或筹集股本也有价格。 However, there is a fundamental problem with this price-based definition of scarcity: anything can be made scarce by assigning ownership of it. Imagine for a moment that the world’s atmosphere belonged to Global Air Ltd, a company which could charge a fee to anyone who breathes air. Air would suddenly have become scarce, according to the price-based theory of scarcity. That might seem like an extreme example, and yet some people have argued that assigning ownership to the atmosphere would solve the problem of air pollution, on the grounds that it would result in the air’s owners having an economic incentive to maintain an unpolluted atmosphere. 然而，这种以价格为基础的稀缺性定义存在一个根本性问题：通过分配所有权，任何东西都可以变得稀缺。想象一下，世界上的大气层属于Global Air Ltd公司，该公司可以向任何呼吸空气的人收取费用。根据以价格为基础的稀缺性理论，空气突然变得稀缺了。这可能看起来像是一个极端的例子，但有些人认为，将大气层的所有权分配给某些人将解决空气污染问题，因为这将导致大气层的所有者有经济激励去维护无污染的大气层。 Here I will use a different meaning of scarcity, one not based on price. I will call something scarce when there is less of it than we require to meet our needs. If people are starving because not enough food has been produced (or made available), food is scarce. Insofar as more knowledge would allow this problem to be solved, this can be thought of as technological (as opposed to economic) scarcity. The point here is that technological progress makes things less scarce. As I discuss in Part Two below, the eighteenth-century scholar Thomas Malthus (1798) was correct when he predicted that global population growth would be exponential, but his prediction that such growth would outpace growth in the food supply, resulting in ongoing shortages and mass starvation, turned out to be wrong, because technological progress resulted in exponential increases in food production. In fact, recent advances in agricultural techniques have meant that the amount of land needed for food production is now declining, even as food production is continuing to grow rapidly. 在这里，我将使用一种不基于价格的不同意义来定义“稀缺”。当某物的数量少于我们需要满足需求时，我将称之为稀缺。如果人们因为食品生产（或供应）不足而挨饿，食品就是稀缺的。在更多的知识将能够解决这个问题的情况下，这可以被认为是技术（而不是经济）的稀缺。这里的重点是，技术进步使事物不再稀缺。正如我在下面的第二部分中所讨论的那样，18世纪学者托马斯·马尔萨斯（1798）的预测是正确的，全球人口增长是呈指数增长的，但他的预测，即这种增长会超过食品供应的增长，导致持续短缺和大规模饥荒，结果证明是错误的，因为技术进步导致了食品生产呈指数增长。事实上，最近农业技术的进步意味着食品生产所需的土地数量正在下降，即使食品生产仍在快速增长。 But is it possible to draw a clear distinction between needs and wants? If people are not starving but want more or different food, can food still be scarce? Modern economics equates the two, but intuitively we know that this is not the case. We need to drink water, but want to drink champagne. We need to provide our body with calories, but want to eat caviar. These examples are obviously extremes, but the point is that many different foods can be used to meet the need for calories. Desiring a particular food is a want, while getting enough calories (and other nutrients) is a need. In Part Two, I set out a list of the needs and look at our current and future ability to fulfill them. 但是，是否可能在需求和欲望之间进行明确的区分？如果人们没有挨饿，但想要更多或不同的食物，食物是否仍然稀缺？现代经济学将两者等同起来，但直觉告诉我们这不是事实。我们需要喝水，但想要喝香槟。我们需要提供身体所需的热量，但想要吃鱼子酱。这些例子显然是极端的，但重点是许多不同的食物可以用来满足热量需求。渴望特定的食物是一种欲望，而获得足够的热量（和其他营养物质）则是一种需求。在第二部分中，我列出了需求清单，并探讨了我们当前和未来实现这些需求的能力。 Importantly, if something is no longer scarce, it isn’t necessarily abundant—there is an intermediate stage, which I will call ‘sufficiency’. For instance, there is sufficient land on the planet to meet everyone’s needs, but building housing and growing food still requires significant physical resources, and hence these things are not abundant. I can foresee a time when technological progress makes land and food abundant—imagine how much space we would have if we could figure out how to live on other planets. Digital information is already on a clear path to abundance: we can make copies of it and distribute them at zero marginal cost, thus meeting the information needs of everyone connected to the Internet. 重要的是，如果某样东西不再稀缺，它不一定是丰富的--有一个中间阶段，我将称之为 \"充足\"。例如，地球上有足够的土地来满足每个人的需求，但建造住房和种植食物仍然需要大量的物理资源，因此这些东西并不丰富。我可以预见，当技术进步使土地和食物变得丰富的时候--想象一下，如果我们能够弄清楚如何在其他星球上生活，我们会有多少空间。数字信息已经走上了一条明确的丰裕之路：我们可以复制它，并以零边际成本分发，从而满足每个与互联网连接的人的信息需求。 With this needs-based definition of scarcity in place, we can now examine how technology has shifted the constraining scarcity for humanity over time. 有了这个以需求为基础的稀缺性定义，我们现在可以考察技术如何随着时间推移改变了人类所面临的约束性稀缺性。 "},"docs/Part_One_Laying_a_Foundation/History.html":{"url":"docs/Part_One_Laying_a_Foundation/History.html","title":"历史","keywords":"","body":"历史 I will now provide a highly abstract account of human history that focuses on how technology has shifted scarcity over time and how those shifts have contributed to dramatic changes in human societies. 我现在将对人类历史进行高度抽象的描述，重点是技术如何随着时间的推移而转移稀缺性，以及这些转移如何促成了人类社会的巨大变化。 Homo sapiens emerged roughly two hundred and fifty thousand years ago. Over most of the time since, humans were foragers (also referred to as hunter-gatherers). During the Forager Age, the defining scarcity was food. Tribes either found enough food in their territory, migrated further or starved. 智人大约是在二十五万年前出现的。在此后的大部分时间里，人类都是觅食者（也被称为狩猎-采集者）。在狩猎采集时代，决定性的稀缺是食物。部落要么在他们的领土上找到足够的食物，要么进一步迁移，要么饿死。 Then, roughly ten thousand years ago, humanity came up with a series of technologies such as the planting of seeds, irrigation and the domestication of animals that together we recognize today as agriculture. These technologies shifted the scarcity from food to land in what became the Agrarian Age. A society that had enough arable land (on which food can be grown), could meet its needs and flourish. It could, in fact, create a food surplus that allowed for the existence of groups such as artists and soldiers that were not directly involved in food production. 然后，大约一万年前，人类想出了一系列技术，如播种、灌溉和驯化动物，我们今天一起称为农业。这些技术将食物的稀缺性转移到土地上，成为农业时代。一个社会如果有足够的可耕地（可以种植食物），就可以满足其需求并繁荣发展。事实上，它可以创造粮食盈余，使艺术家和士兵等不直接参与粮食生产的群体得以存在。 More recently, beginning about four hundred years ago with the Enlightenment, humanity invented a new series of technologies, including steam power, mechanical machines, chemistry, mining, and eventually technologies to produce, transmit and harness electricity. Collectively we refer to these today as the Industrial Revolution, and the age that followed as the Industrial Age. Once again, the scarcity shifted, this time away from food and towards capital, such as buildings, machinery and roads. Capital was scarce because we couldn’t meet the needs of a growing human population, including the need for calories, without building agricultural machines, producing fertilizer and constructing housing. 最近，从大约四百年前的启蒙运动开始，人类发明了一系列新技术，包括蒸汽动力、机械、化学、采矿，以及最终生产、传输和利用电力的技术。今天我们把这些统称为工业革命，把随后的时代称为工业时代。稀缺性再次发生变化，这一次从食物转向资本，如建筑、机械和道路。资本是稀缺的，因为如果不建造农业机械、生产肥料和建造住房，我们就无法满足不断增长的人类人口的需求，包括对卡路里的需求。 In each of those two prior transitions, the way humanity lived changed radically. In the transition from the Forager Age to the Agrarian Age we went from being nomadic to sedentary, from flat tribal societies to extremely hierarchical feudal societies, from promiscuity to monogamy (sort of), and from animistic religions to theistic ones. In the transition from the Agrarian Age to the Industrial Age we went from living in the country to living in the city, from large extended families to nuclear families or no family at all, from commons to private property (including private intellectual property) and from great-chain-of-being theologies to the Protestant work ethic. 在之前的两次过渡中，人类的生活方式都发生了根本性的变化。在从狩猎采集时代到农业时代的过渡中，我们从游牧到定居，从扁平的部落社会到等级森严的封建社会，从滥交到一夫一妻制（某种程度上），以及从泛灵论宗教到有神论宗教。在从农业时代到工业时代的过渡中，我们从生活在乡村到生活在城市，从大家庭到核心家庭或根本没有家庭，从公有财产到私有财产（包括私人知识产权），从伟大的生命链神学到新教的工作伦理。 What accounts for these changes? In each transition the nature of the scarcity changed in a way that made measurement of human effort more difficult, which in turn required more sophisticated ways of providing incentives to sustain the necessary level of effort. 是什么原因导致了这些变化？在每一次转型中，稀缺性的性质都发生了变化，使得对人类努力的衡量更加困难，这反过来又需要更复杂的方式来提供激励，以维持必要的努力水平。 In the Forager Age, when the key scarcity was food, the measurement and incentive problem was almost trivial: everyone in a tribe sees how much food the hunters and gatherers bring back, and it is either enough to feed everyone or not. In so-called immediate return societies (which had no storage) that is literally all there is to it. With storage the story gets slightly more complicated, but not by much. I believe that this explains many of the features of successful foraging tribal societies, including the flat hierarchy and the equality of sharing. 在狩猎采集时代，关键的稀缺资源是食物，衡量和激励问题几乎是微不足道的：部落中的每个人都可以看到猎人和采集者带回了多少食物，它要么足以养活每个人，要么不足。在所谓的直接回报社会（没有存储）中，这就是全部内容。随着储存的出现，故事变得稍微复杂了一些，但并没有太多变化。我认为这解释了成功的狩猎采集部落社会的许多特征，包括平等的分配和扁平的等级制度。 In the Agrarian Age, when the scarcity was land, the measurement problem got significantly harder: you can really only tell at harvest time (once per year in many regions of the world) how well-off a society will be. Again, I believe that this explains many of the features of successful agrarian societies, in particular the need for a lot of structure and strict rules. It is crucial to keep in mind that these societies were essentially pre-scientific, so they had to find out what works by trial and error. When they found a rule that seemed to work, they wanted to stick with it and codify it (much of this happened via the theistic religions). 在农业时代，当稀缺的是土地时，衡量问题变得明显困难：你真的只能在收获季节（在世界许多地区每年一次）知道一个社会将有多富裕。我再次相信，这解释了成功的农业社会的许多特征，特别是对大量结构和严格规则的需求。关键是要记住，这些社会基本上是前科学社会，所以他们不得不通过试验和错误来发现什么是可行的。当他们发现一个似乎有效的规则时，他们想坚持下去并将其编纂成法典（这在很大程度上是通过有神论宗教发生的）。 In the Industrial Age, when the scarcity was capital, the measurement problem became even harder. How do you decide where a factory should be built and what it should produce? It might take years of process and product innovation to put physical capital together that is truly productive. I believe that this explains much of the success of the market-based model, especially when contrasted with planned economies. Effectively, the solution to the incentive problem moved from static rules to a dynamic process that allows for many experiments to take place and only a few of them to succeed. 在工业时代，当稀缺的是资本时，衡量问题变得更加困难。你如何决定在哪里建立工厂以及它应该生产什么？可能需要数年的过程和产品创新才能组合出真正具有生产力的物质资本。我相信这解释了市场模型的很多成功，特别是与计划经济相比。事实上，激励问题的解决方案从静态规则转向了一个动态过程，允许进行许多实验，只有其中很少一些会成功。 These changes in how humanity lives were responses to an increasingly difficult measurement problem, as technological progress shifted scarcity from food to land and then from land to capital. But the transitions don’t occur deterministically; they are the result of human choice driving changes in regulation. For example, when it came to the scarcity of capital, humanity tried out radically different approaches between market-based and planned economies. As it turned out, competitive markets, combined with entrepreneurialism and the strategic deployment of state support (e.g. in the form of regulation), were better at allocating and accumulating capital. Similarly, the Agrarian Age contained vastly different societies, including the Athenian democracy, which was hugely advanced compared to much of Northern European society in the Middle Ages. 这些人类生活方式的变化是对日益困难的衡量问题的应对，随着技术进步，稀缺性从食物转向土地，再从土地转向资本。但这些转变并不是必然发生的，它们是由人类选择引发的，推动着监管变化。例如，当资本稀缺时，人类尝试了市场经济和计划经济之间根本不同的方法。事实证明，竞争市场与创业精神以及战略性地利用国家支持（例如通过监管形式）更好地分配和积累资本。同样，农业时代包含着非常不同的社会，包括与中世纪北欧社会相比极为先进的雅典民主。 The other important point to note about the previous transitions is that they took quite some time and were incredibly violent. Agriculture emerged over the span of thousands of years, during which time agrarian societies slowly expanded, either subduing or killing foraging tribes. The transition from the Agrarian Age to the Industrial Age played out over several hundred years and involved many bloody revolutions and ultimately two world wars. At the end of the Agrarian Age, the ruling elites had gained their power from controlling land and still believed it to be the critical scarcity. For them, industry was a means of building and equipping increasingly powerful armies with tanks and battleships to ensure control over land. Even the Second World War was about land, as Hitler pursued “Lebensraum“ (literally “room to live”) for his Third Reich. It was only after the Second World War that we finally left the Agrarian Age behind for good. 另一个需要注意的关键点是，之前的转变需要相当长的时间，并且非常暴力。农业的出现需要数千年的时间，在此期间，农业社会缓慢扩张，要么消灭了狩猎采集部落，要么迫使他们采取农业生产。从农业时代到工业时代的转变经历了数百年的时间，并涉及许多血腥的革命，最终引发了两次世界大战。在农业时代的末期，统治精英们通过控制土地获得了他们的权力，仍然认为土地是至关重要的稀缺资源。对他们来说，工业是建立和装备越来越强大的军队的手段，以确保对土地的控制。即使第二次世界大战也是关于土地的，希特勒追求为他的第三帝国提供“Lebensraum”（字面意思是“生存空间”）。直到第二次世界大战结束后，我们才最终永久地离开了农业时代。 We now, once again, find ourselves in a transition period, because digital technology is shifting the scarcity from capital to attention. What should be clear by now is that this transition will also require dramatic changes in how humanity lives, just as the two prior transitions did. It is also likely that the transition will play itself out over several generations, instead of being accomplished quickly. 我们现在再次处于一个过渡期，因为数字技术正在将稀缺从资本转移到注意力。现在应该清楚的是，这个转变也将需要像前两个转变一样人类生活方式的巨大变革。这个转变也可能会在几代人的时间内逐步发生，而不是迅速完成。 Finally, there is a historic similarity to the transition out of the Agrarian Age that explains why many governments have been focused on incremental changes. To understand, we should first note that capital today is frequently thought of as monetary wealth or financial capital, even though it is productive capital (machines, buildings and infrastructure) that really matters. Financial capital allows for the formation of physical capital, but it does not directly add to the production of goods and services. Companies only require financial capital because they have to pay for machines, supplies and labor before they receive payment for the product or service they provide. 最后，与退出农业时代的转变有一个历史上的相似之处，这解释了为什么许多政府一直关注渐进式的改变。要理解这一点，我们首先应该注意，如今资本经常被认为是货币财富或金融资本，尽管真正重要的是生产资本（机器、建筑和基础设施）。金融资本只是生产实体资本的手段，但它并不直接增加物品和服务的生产。公司之所以需要金融资本，是因为他们必须在提供产品或服务之前支付机器、物料和劳动力的费用。 Just as the ruling elites at the end of the Agrarian Age came from land, the ruling elites today come from capital. They often don’t take up political roles themselves but rather have ways of influencing policy indirectly, exposing them to less personal risk. A good recent example is the role of the billionaire hedge fund manager Robert Mercer and his family in supporting groups that influenced the outcome of the US Presidential election in 2016, such as the right-wing news organization Breitbart (Gold, 2017). 与农业时代末期的统治精英来自土地一样，今天的统治精英来自资本。他们通常不直接担任政治角色，而是通过间接影响政策的方式，暴露在更少的个人风险中。一个很好的最近例子是亿万富翁对冲基金经理罗伯特·默瑟及其家族在支持影响2016年美国总统选举结果的团体方面所起的作用，例如右翼新闻机构Breitbart（Gold，2017）。 "},"docs/Part_One_Laying_a_Foundation/Plan_of_Attack.html":{"url":"docs/Part_One_Laying_a_Foundation/Plan_of_Attack.html","title":"攻略","keywords":"","body":"攻略 My first major claim is that capital, at least in the technological sense, is no longer scarce. We have sufficient productive capital to meet our needs through growing food, constructing buildings, producing clothes, and so on. To establish this, I will start by setting out a catalog of individual and collective needs. I will then examine current population trends to see what we can learn about the future growth in these needs, followed by an evaluation of our available capital and its ability to meet those needs. That entire section of The World After Capital shows that physical capital is sufficient in aggregate. It does not address questions of wealth distribution, which will be discussed later. 我的第一个主要论点是，至少在技术意义上，资本不再是稀缺资源。我们有足够的生产资本来满足种植粮食、建造建筑物、生产衣服等方面的需求。为了证明这一点，我将开始列出个人和集体需求的目录。然后，我将研究当前的人口趋势，看看我们可以从中了解到未来这些需求的增长情况，随后评估我们可用的资本以及它满足这些需求的能力。整个《资本后的世界》一书的这一部分表明，物质资本在总体上已经足够。它不涉及财富分配的问题，这个问题将在后面讨论。 My second claim is that attention is now the key scarcity, meaning that our present allocation of attention is resulting in humanity’s needs not being met. To establish this I will start by pinning down more precisely what attention is and presenting several examples of human needs that either are already no longer met, such as the need for meaning, or that are at risk of not being met in the future, such as calories due to the climate crisis—all due to a lack of attention. After that I will consider how much human attention is currently caught up in Industrial Age activities, and how more attention is being trapped through the dominant uses of digital technology, such as advertising-based social networks. I will also discuss why market-based capitalism cannot be used to allocate attention. 我的第二个观点是，关注现在是关键的稀缺资源，这意味着我们目前对关注的分配导致人类的需求无法得到满足。为了证实这一点，我将开始更精确地概括关注的定义，并提出几个人类需求的例子，其中一些已经不能得到满足，比如对意义的需求，而其他一些则可能在未来无法得到满足，比如由于气候危机导致的卡路里需求，所有这些都是由于缺乏关注而造成的。之后，我将考虑人类关注力目前有多少被工业时代的活动所占用，以及数字技术的主要用途，如基于广告的社交网络，如何捕捉更多的关注。我还将讨论为什么市场驱动的资本主义无法用于分配关注。 I will then make concrete suggestions for how to facilitate the transition to the next age, which I call the Knowledge Age. In keeping with the ideas about knowledge and humanism that I presented earlier, my suggestions focus on increasing freedoms as the basis for more available attention and improved allocation of that attention. 然后，我将就如何促进向下一个时代（我称之为信息时代）的过渡提出具体建议。为了与我之前提出的关于知识和人文主义的想法保持一致，我的建议侧重于增加自由，作为更多可用注意力和改进注意力分配的基础。 "},"docs/Part_Two_Capital_Is_Sufficient.html":{"url":"docs/Part_Two_Capital_Is_Sufficient.html","title":"第二部分：资本充足","keywords":"","body":"第二部分：资本充足 In saying that capital is ‘sufficient’, I mean that there is enough of it to meet our needs. That’s what I set out to show in this part of the book. The only way to do so is by examining what those needs are, and separating them clearly from our unlimited wants. We must then consider population trends, so we can see how many humans are likely to have those needs in the future. Only then can we attempt to see if our existing capital is sufficient to meet them. 在说资本是 \"充足的\"，是指有足够的资本来满足我们的需要。这就是我在本书的这一部分所要说明的。做到这一点的唯一方法是检查这些需求是什么，并将它们与我们无限的需求明确分开。然后我们必须考虑人口趋势，这样我们就可以看到未来有多少人可能会有这些需求。只有这样，我们才能尝试看看我们现有的资本是否足以满足它们。 "},"docs/Part_Two_Capital_Is_Sufficient/Needs.html":{"url":"docs/Part_Two_Capital_Is_Sufficient/Needs.html","title":"需求","keywords":"","body":"需求 The definition of scarcity introduced in Part One is based on the idea of needs, so to argue that we are currently experiencing a shift to attention being the new scarcity requires me to demonstrate that we have sufficient capital for meeting our needs. But agreeing on what constitutes human needs is not a simple task. What follows should be seen as a step along the way. A list of needs is the type of externalized human knowledge that can be improved over time through the process of critical inquiry. 第一部分介绍的稀缺性的定义是基于需求的概念，所以要论证我们目前正经历着注意力成为新的稀缺性的转变，需要我证明我们有足够的资本来满足我们的需求。但就什么是人类需求达成一致并不是一件简单的事情。下面的内容应该被看作是这条道路上的一个步骤。一份\"需要清单\"是一种通过批判性探究过程可以不断改进的外部化人类知识类型。 In an early draft of The World After Capital, I grouped needs into categories such as ‘biological’, ‘physical’ and ‘social’, but the boundaries between them seemed rather arbitrary. So instead I distinguish here between individual and collective needs, where the former apply to a single person and the latter are the needs of humanity. Another challenge in putting together such a list is that it is easy to confuse a need with a strategy for meeting it. For instance, eating meat is a strategy for addressing our need for calories, but humans can, of course, acquire calories from many sources. 在《资本后的世界》的早期草稿中，我将需求分为 \"生物\"、\"物理 \"和 \"社会 \"等类别，但它们之间的界限似乎相当随意。因此，我在这里区分了个人需求和集体需求，前者适用于一个人，后者则是人类的需求。把这样一个清单放在一起的另一个挑战是，很容易把需求和满足需求的策略混淆起来。例如，吃肉是解决我们对卡路里需求的一种策略，但人类当然可以从许多来源获得卡路里。 Individual Needs 个人需求 These are the basic needs of the human body and mind, without which individual survival is impossible. A single individual has these needs even when they are completely isolated, such as if they are traveling alone in a spaceship. The first set of individual needs relates to keeping our bodies powered. These include: 这些是人类身体和心智的基本需求，没有它们个体的生存是不可能的。即使完全孤立，例如独自乘坐太空船旅行，单个个体也有这些需求。第一组个体需求涉及维持身体的能量。这些包括： Oxygen. On average, humans need about 550 liters of oxygen every day, depending on the size of our body and physical exertion. Our most common way of meeting this need is breathing air (\"How Much Oxygen Does a Person Consume in a Day?,\" 2000). Although that may sound obvious, we have developed other solutions through technology – for example, the blood of patients struggling to breathe can be oxygenated externally. 氧气。平均而言，人类每天需要大约550升的氧气，这取决于我们的身体大小和体力消耗情况。我们满足这一需求的最常见方式是呼吸空气（\"一个人一天要消耗多少氧气？\"，2000年）。虽然这听起来很明显，但我们已经通过技术开发了其他解决方案--例如，挣扎着呼吸的病人的血液可以从外部获得氧气。 Water. We need to ingest two or three liters of water per day to stay hydrated, depending on factors such as body size, exertion and temperature (\"Water: How Much Should You Drink Every Day?,\" 2020). In addition to drinking water and fluids that contain it, we have other solutions for this, such as the water contained in the foods that we eat. 水。我们每天需要摄入两到三升的水以保持水分，这取决于身体大小、体力消耗和温度等因素（\"水：你每天应该喝多少？\"2020）。除了喝水和含有水的液体，我们还有其他解决方案，例如我们吃的食物中含有的水。 Calories. To power our bodies, adults need between 1,500 and 3,200 calories per day, a need we mainly meet by eating and drinking (U.S. Department of Agriculture and U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2015). The best way to obtain calories, however, is surprisingly poorly understood – the mix between proteins, lipids and carbohydrates is subject to debate. 卡路里。为了给我们的身体提供动力，成年人每天需要1500至3200卡路里，我们主要通过吃喝来满足这一需求（美国农业部和美国卫生与公众服务部，2015）。然而，获得卡路里的最佳方式令人惊讶地不太了解--蛋白质、脂类和碳水化合物之间的混合是有争议的。 Nutrients. The body cannot synthesize all the materials it requires, including certain amino acids, vitamins and minerals – these must be obtained as part of our nutrition. This is another area that is surprisingly poorly understood, meaning that the mix of nutrients we need to take in seems unsettled. 营养物质。身体无法合成它所需要的所有材料，包括某些氨基酸、维生素和矿物质--这些必须作为我们营养的一部分获得。这是另一个出人意料地不甚了解的领域，这意味着我们需要摄入的营养物质的组合似乎还没有定论。 Discharge. We also need to get things out of our bodies by expelling processed food, radiating heat and exhaling carbon dioxide. Humans have made a great deal of progress around meeting our discharge needs, such as toilets and public sanitation. 排泄。我们还需要通过排出加工过的食物、散发热量和呼出二氧化碳来把东西排出体外。人类已经在满足我们的排放需求方面取得了很大的进展，例如厕所和公共卫生设施。 The second set of individual needs relates to the operating environment for humans. From a cosmic perspective, humans have an incredibly narrow operating range. Even here on Earth we can live without technological assistance only in relatively few places. Here are some of our basic operating needs: 第二组个人需求与人类的生存环境有关。从宇宙的角度来看，人类有一个令人难以置信的狭窄的操作范围。即使在地球上，我们也只能在相对较少的地方没有技术援助地生活。以下是我们的一些基本操作需求： Temperature. Our bodies can self-regulate their temperature, but only within a limited range of environmental temperature and humidity. Humans can easily freeze to death or die of overheating (we cool our bodies through sweating, also known as ‘evaporative cooling’, which stops working when the air gets too hot and humid). We therefore often need to help our bodies with temperature regulation by controlling our environment. Common strategies to meet our temperature needs include clothing, shelter, heating and air conditioning. 温度。我们的身体可以自我调节温度，但只能在有限的环境温度和湿度范围内进行。人类很容易被冻死或死于过热（我们通过出汗来冷却我们的身体，也称为 \"蒸发冷却\"，当空气变得太热和太潮湿时，它就会停止工作）。因此，我们经常需要通过控制环境来帮助我们的身体进行温度调节。满足我们温度需求的常见策略包括衣服、住所、暖气和空调。 Pressure. Anybody who has gone diving will be aware that our bodies do not handle increased pressure very well. The same goes for decreased pressure, which is one of the reasons why we find air travel exhausting (airplane cabins maintain pressure similar to being at the top of an eight-thousand-foot mountain). 压力。任何去过潜水的人都会知道，我们的身体不能很好地处理增加的压力。压力降低也是如此，这也是我们觉得航空旅行很累的原因之一（飞机舱内保持的压力类似于在八千英尺的山顶上）。 Light. Most humans would be hard-pressed to achieve much in complete darkness. For a long time, our need for light was met mainly by sunlight, but much human ingenuity has gone into the creation of artificial light sources. 光。大多数人类在完全黑暗的环境中很难取得什么成就。长期以来，我们对光的需求主要由阳光来满足，但人类在创造人工光源方面有很多独创性。 The third set of individual needs arises from how we deal with a complex and ever-changing environment. As we go through life, we all encounter challenges that we need to overcome, resulting in three fundamental individual needs: 第三组个人需求产生于我们如何处理复杂和不断变化的环境。在我们的生活中，我们都会遇到需要克服的挑战，从而产生了三种基本的个人需求： Healing. Whenever we damage our body, it needs to heal. The human body comes equipped with extensive systems for self-healing, but beyond a certain range it needs external assistance. We have developed many solutions, which are often grouped under the term ‘healthcare’. 治疗。每当我们损害身体时，它就需要愈合。人体配备了广泛的自我修复系统，但超过一定范围，就需要外部援助。我们已经开发了许多解决方案，这些解决方案通常被归入 \"保健 \"一词。 Learning. When we are born, we are quite incompetent – we have to learn basic skills, such as walking and how to use even the simplest tools. When we encounter a new situation, we have to learn how to deal with it. We group many of the strategies for meeting the need for learning under the heading ‘education’, but other solutions include experimenting to gain experience, self-study and parenting. 学习。当我们出生时，我们是无知的--我们必须学习基本技能，如走路和如何使用最简单的工具。当我们遇到一个新情况时，我们必须学习如何处理它。我们将许多满足学习需求的策略归入 \"教育 \"的标题下，但其他解决方案包括通过实验来获得经验、自学和教养。 Meaning. As humans, we have a profound psychological need for meaning in our lives. One solution is to have a purpose. Religious belief and belonging to a community have long been a source of purpose for humans. Another key strategy comes from our interactions with other humans, including having other people acknowledge our contributions to a project, or even merely recognize our existence. 意义。作为人类，我们对生活的意义有着深刻的心理需求。一个解决办法是有一个目的。宗教信仰和对社区的归属长期以来一直是人类目的的来源。另一个关键的策略来自于我们与其他人类的互动，包括让其他人承认我们对某个项目的贡献，甚至只是承认我们的存在。 This last set of needs may strike you as being at a much higher level than the earlier ones. The idea of sorting individual needs into a hierarchy, as the psychologist Abraham Maslow famously did, is intuitively appealing, but it is misleading – all of these needs are vital. For example, Maslow put needs like calories at the bottom and needs like meaning at the top, implying that calories are more foundational than meaning. But we know from the work of Viktor Frankl and others that meaning is essential to human effort and that accessing calories requires effort. As a thought exercise, picture yourself alone in a spaceship and try to remove any of the above. You’ll soon realize that they are all equally important. 这最后一组需求可能会让你觉得比前面的需求层次高得多。正如心理学家亚伯拉罕-马斯洛（Abraham Maslow）所做的那样，将个人需求分为一个等级，这种想法在直觉上很吸引人，但这是一种误导--所有这些需求都是至关重要的。例如，马斯洛把卡路里这样的需求放在最下面，而把意义这样的需求放在最上面，这意味着卡路里比意义更具有基础性。但我们知道，根据维克多·弗兰克尔和其他人的工作，意义对于人类的努力是至关重要的，而获得卡路里需要付出努力。作为一个思维练习，想象自己独自一人在飞船中，并尝试去除上述任何一项。你很快就会意识到，它们都是同样重要的。 Collective Needs 集体需求 Our collective needs arise from living together in societies and sharing space and resources. Meeting them is what allows human societies to survive and advance. 我们的集体需求来自于社会中的共同生活和共享空间和资源。满足这些需求是使人类社会得以生存和发展的原因。 Reproduction. Individuals can survive without sex, but reproduction is a need for societies as a whole. We have learned how to reproduce without sex; in the future, there may be different solutions for the continuation of a human society – whether here on Earth or elsewhere. 繁衍。个人可以在没有性的情况下生存，但繁衍是整个社会的需要。我们已经学会了如何在没有性的情况下进行繁殖；在未来，可能会有不同的解决方案来延续一个人类社会--无论是在地球上还是在其他地方。 Allocation. Access to physical resources has to be allocated. Take a chair as an example. Only one person can comfortably sit in it at a time – when there are multiple people, we need a way of allocating the chair between them. If you are by yourself, you can sit on a chair whenever you want to – allocation is a collective need. 分配。对物理资源的使用必须进行分配。以一把椅子为例，一次只能有一个人舒服地坐在上面--当有多个人的时候，我们需要一种在他们之间分配椅子的方法。如果你是一个人，你可以随时坐在椅子上--分配是一种集体需要。 Motivation. This may seem like an individual need, but it acts as a collective one in the sense that societies must motivate their members to carry out important tasks and follow rules. Even the smallest and least technologically advanced societies have solutions for this problem, often in the form of rewards and punishments. 激励。这似乎是一种个人需求，但它作为一种集体需求，社会必须激励其成员执行重要任务和遵守规则。即使是最小的、技术最不发达的社会也有解决这个问题的办法，通常是以奖励和惩罚的形式。 Coordination. Whenever more than a single human is involved in any activity, coordination is needed. Take a simple meeting between two people as an example. In order for it to take place, the two need to show up at the same place at the same time. We have developed many communication and governance mechanisms to address this need. 协调。每当有超过一个人参与任何活动时，都需要协调。以两个人之间的简单会议为例。为了使会议顺利进行，两人需要在同一时间出现在同一地点。我们已经开发了许多沟通和治理机制来解决这一需求。 Knowledge. As I argued in earlier sections on optimism and humanism, knowledge is the central collective human need: without it, a society will encounter problems that it cannot solve. History is full of examples of societies that lacked sufficient knowledge to sustain themselves, such as the Easter Islanders and the Mayans. This is not about what any one individual has learned, but about the body of knowledge that is accessible to society as a whole. Later in this book we will examine solutions for generating more knowledge, faster. 知识。正如我在前面关于乐观主义和人文主义的章节中所论述的，知识是人类的核心集体需求：没有知识，一个社会将遇到它无法解决的问题。历史上有很多社会缺乏足够的知识来维持自己的例子，如复活节岛民和玛雅人。这并不是说任何一个人学到了什么，而是说整个社会可以获得的知识体系。在本书的后面，我们将研究如何更快地产生更多的知识。 These collective needs may strike you as abstract, but this is the result of identifying needs rather than solutions, which are much more concrete and readily recognizable. For instance, governments and laws are examples of solutions to collective needs such as allocation and coordination, as are markets and firms and, more recently, networks and platforms. In other words, many of the institutions of society exist because they help us solve a collective need. 这些集体需求可能会让你觉得很抽象，但这是确定需求而不是确定解决方案的结果，后者要具体得多，而且容易识别。例如，政府和法律是解决分配和协调等集体需求的例子，市场和公司也是如此，现在还有网络和平台。换句话说，许多社会机构的存在是因为它们帮助我们解决了集体需求。 Enablers 助推器 Some things don’t meet specific needs in themselves, but instead enable different solutions. Consider energy, for example. You may well ask: isn’t it something we all need, both individually and collectively? For instance, individually we need energy to maintain the temperature of a house, and collectively we need energy to power our communications infrastructure. As these two examples show, energy itself does not meet needs—rather, it makes possible something that does. It is what I call an enabler. 有些东西本身并不满足特定的需求，而是促成不同的解决方案。例如，考虑一下能源。你可能会问：这不是我们所有人都需要的东西吗，无论是个人还是集体？例如，就个人而言，我们需要能源来维持房屋的温度，就集体而言，我们需要能源来为我们的通信基础设施供电。正如这两个例子所示，能源本身并不能满足需求--相反，它使满足需求成为可能。这就是我所说的 \"助推器\"。 Here are four foundational enablers: 这里有四个基础性的推动因素： Energy. For a long time, humans relied on direct sunlight as their primary energy source. Since then we have developed many ways of generating energy, including better ways of capturing sunlight. Capturing more energy and making it available in highly concentrated and easily controllabe form via electricity has enabled new solutions to human needs. 能源。长期以来，人类依靠直接的阳光作为主要能源。从那时起，我们已经开发了许多产生能源的方法，包括更好的捕捉阳光的方法。捕捉更多的能量，并通过电力以高度集中和容易控制的形式提供给人们，这使得人类的需求有了新的解决方案。 Resources. In early human history, all resources were drawn directly from our natural surroundings. Later, we started growing and extracting resources using progressively more technology. Many modern solutions have been made possible by access to new kinds of resources. For instance, mobile phones, which provide new solutions to individual and collective needs, are made possible in part by esoteric raw materials, including the so-called rare-earth elements. 资源。在人类历史早期，所有的资源都是直接从我们的自然环境中提取的。后来，我们开始使用逐渐变多的技术来种植和提取资源。许多现代解决方案都是通过获取新型资源而实现的。例如，为个人和集体需求提供新的解决方案的移动电话，部分是由稀缺的原材料，包括所谓的稀土元素实现的。 Transformation. Energy and resources alone are not enough. To enable most solutions, we need to figure out (and remember!) how to use the former to transform the latter. This involves chemical and physical processes. Physical capital, in the shape of machines, has been a crucial enabler of many new solutions to human needs. For instance, a knitting machine can quickly transform yarn into clothing, one of our key solutions for maintaining the human operating environment. 转变。仅有能源和资源是不够的。为了实现大多数解决方案，我们需要弄清楚（并记住！）如何使用前者来转化后者。这涉及到化学和物理过程。以机器的形式出现，一直是许多满足人类需求的新解决方案的重要推动者。例如，一台针织机可以迅速将纱线转化为衣服，这是我们维护人类操作环境的关键解决方案之一。 Transportation. The final foundational enabler is the ability to move stuff, including people. This is another area in which we have made great progress, going from human-powered to animal-powered to machine-powered transportation. 运输。最后一个基础性的推动因素是移动东西的能力，包括人。这是我们取得巨大进展的另一个领域，从人力驱动到动物驱动再到机器驱动的运输。 As in the case of needs, I have deliberately chosen enablers that have a high degree of abstraction. Coal-fired power plants provide energy, as do solar panels – and nuclear fusion will do the same at some point in the future. These three examples have dramatically different characteristics, but they are all energy enablers. 与需求的情况一样，我特意选择了具有高度抽象性的促成因素。燃煤电厂提供能源，太阳能电池板也提供能源--核聚变在未来的某个时候也会这样做。这三个例子有着截然不同的特点，但它们都是能源的推动者。 While I expect further changes, I believe that my current version of needs and enablers satisfies my argument that there is sufficient productive capital in the world. To establish this in more quantitative terms, though, we need to consider the size and growth of the human population. 虽然我期待着进一步的变化，但我相信我目前版本的需求和促成因素满足了我的论点，即世界上有足够的生产资本。不过，为了从数量上确定这一点，我们需要考虑人类人口的规模和增长。 "},"docs/Part_Two_Capital_Is_Sufficient/Population.html":{"url":"docs/Part_Two_Capital_Is_Sufficient/Population.html","title":"人口","keywords":"","body":"人口 In 1798, Thomas Malthus predicted widespread famine as the human population grew exponentially, outstripping increases in humanity’s ability to grow food (Malthus, 1798). His prediction was half-right: the global population did explode at the start of the nineteenth century. 1798年，托马斯-马尔萨斯预言，随着人类人口的急剧增长，超过了人类种植食物能力的增长，饥荒将普遍发生（马尔萨斯，1798）。他的预测对了一半：全球人口在19世纪初确实爆发了。 Since then, the human population has grown from about 1 billion to nearly 8 billion people (\"World Population Clock: 7.9 Billion People\", 2021). However, Malthus’s dire warnings about the consequences of this population growth have proven wrong. There has been no global-scale starvation, and most people do not live in abject poverty. In fact, the number of people living in extreme poverty around the world has declined, even though population growth has been about twice as fast as Malthus’s predicted upper limit of 1 billion people added over 25 years (Roser & Ortiz-Ospina, 2013). 从那时起，人类人口已从约10亿增长到近80亿（\"世界人口时钟：79亿人\"，2021年）。然而，马尔萨斯关于这种人口增长的后果可怕警告已被证明是错误的。没有出现全球规模的饥荒，大多数人没有生活在赤贫中。事实上，尽管人口增长的速度是马尔萨斯预测的25年内增加10亿人口上限的两倍，但全世界生活在极端贫困中的人数已经下降了（Roser & Ortiz-Ospina, 2013）。 What Malthus got wrong was the rate of technological progress. First, he was pessimistic about our ability to improve agricultural productivity. Since his writing, there have been huge advances in agriculture: the percentage of the global workforce employed in the sector has declined from more than 80 per cent to 33 per cent, and is falling rapidly (in the US and other advanced economies, agriculture represents 2 per cent of employment or less). In the last 50 years alone, the land required to produce a given quantity of food has declined by 68 per cent (Ritchie & Roser , 2019). The total amount of land used to produce food has still continued to grow at least until recently, but much more slowly than the population (Ausubel et al., 2013; Ewers et al., 2009). 马尔萨斯弄错的是技术进步的速度。首先，他对我们提高农业生产力的能力持悲观态度。自他写作以来，农业已经有了巨大的进步：全球劳动力中受雇于农业部门的比例已经从80%以上下降到33%，而且正在迅速下降（在美国和其他发达经济体，农业占就业的2%或更少）。仅在过去50年里，生产一定数量的食物所需的土地就减少了68%（Ritchie & Roser , 2019）。至少到最近，用于生产粮食的土地总量仍在继续增长，但比人口增长的速度要慢得多（Ausubel等人，2013；Ewers等人，2009）。 Second, Malthus could not foresee the scientific breakthroughs that enabled the Industrial Revolution. That revolution not only powered the increase in agricultural productivity, but also gave us dramatic advances in living standards, including increased life expectancy, faster transportation and cheaper communication. 第二，马尔萨斯无法预见到促成工业革命的科学突破。这场革命不仅推动了农业生产力的提高，还使我们的生活水平有了巨大的进步，包括预期寿命的延长、更快的交通和更便宜的通信。 ​​ Population Growth Source: World Bank, 2020a; 2020b; United Nations, 2019 This matters, because as it turns out, population growth responds to progress. In particular, there is a strong and well-documented relationship between levels of infant mortality, living standards, and birth rates. As better medical technology reduces infant mortality and better production technology increases living standards, birth rates decline. This is not a mechanistic relationship but involves complex social adjustments, such as women entering the workforce and other forms of empowerment for women (e.g., better access to education). Max Roser and the team at the “Our World In Data” project have produced some beautiful charts that show how this effect of progress on birth rates has occurred all around the world (Roser, 2017). 这很重要，因为事实证明，人口增长对进步有反应。特别是，在婴儿死亡率、生活水平和出生率之间存在着一种强有力的、有据可查的关系。随着更好的医疗技术降低婴儿死亡率，更好的生产技术提高生活水平，出生率就会下降。这不是一种机械的关系，而是涉及复杂的社会调整，如妇女进入劳动力市场和其他形式的女性赋权（例如，更好的教育机会）。马克斯-罗瑟和 \"我们的数据世界 \"项目的团队制作了一些漂亮的图表，显示了进步对出生率的这种影响是如何发生在世界各地的（罗瑟，2017）。 So despite the extraordinary growth in global population over the last 200 years, simply assuming that it will continue into the future would be a mistake: there are strong signs that the world’s population is likely to peak. Some people claim that this debate is crucial because they don’t think the world can sustain, say, 11 billion people. However, this argument misses a key point. The world cannot sustain its current population of nearly 8 billion people either, unless we continue to make technological progress. The ways we have managed to supply 8 billion people so far have created all sorts of new problems, such as water and air pollution and, most pressingly, the climate crisis. 因此，尽管全球人口在过去200年里有了超凡的增长，但简单地假设它将持续到未来将是一个错误：有强烈的迹象表明，世界人口有可能达到峰值。有些人声称，这场辩论至关重要，因为他们认为世界无法维持，比如110亿人口。然而，这种说法忽略了一个关键点，除非我们继续取得技术进步，否则世界也无法维持其目前近80亿的人口。迄今为止，我们设法供应80亿人口的方式已经产生了各种新问题，如水和空气污染，以及最紧迫的气候危机。 In fact Malthus's predictions may yet catch up with us. For example, if we don’t rapidly address the climate crisis, we may experience large scale crop failure resulting in mass starvation. This would be an example of having insufficient technology for producing enough food, in contrast to many past examples of mass starvation, such as in India, that were the result of social and political breakdowns from internal strife or external interference disrupting food production or distribution. 事实上，马尔萨斯的预言可能还会追上我们。例如，如果我们不迅速解决气候危机，我们可能会经历大规模的作物歉收，导致大规模的饥饿。这将是生产足够食物的技术不足的一个例子，与过去许多大规模饥饿的例子相比，例如在印度，是由于内部冲突或外部干扰破坏了食物生产或分配的社会和政治崩溃的结果。 Still, the key takeaway should be that needs will not continue to grow exponentially because A) population growth will slow down, and B) needs per person are limited. All the signs suggest that the global population curve is starting to decelerate, whereas the rate of technical progress is continuing to accelerate (Roser, 2019a; Roser & Ritchie, 2013). Knowing these things, we can be optimistic about progress in relationship to population growth. In other words, Malthus will ultimately turn out to have been be wrong both about the rate of technological progress and the long-term rate of population growth. 不过，关键启示应该是，需求不会继续呈指数级增长，因为A）人口增长将放缓，B）每人的需求是有限的。所有迹象表明，全球人口曲线开始减速，而技术进步的速度在继续加快（Roser, 2019a; Roser & Ritchie, 2013）。了解了这些情况，我们可以对与人口增长有关的进展持乐观态度。换句话说，马尔萨斯最终将被证明在技术进步率和人口增长的长期速度方面都是错误的。 I have already described why digital technology is so disruptive. We will see in more detail later how it is contributing to an acceleration of knowledge creation, and thus progress. 我已经描述了为什么数字技术是如此具有颠覆性。我们将在后面更详细地看到它是如何促进知识创造的加速，从而促进进步的。 "},"docs/Part_Two_Capital_Is_Sufficient/Capital.html":{"url":"docs/Part_Two_Capital_Is_Sufficient/Capital.html","title":"资本","keywords":"","body":"资本 As implied by the title of this book, one of my fundamental claims is that there is enough capital in the world to meet everyone’s needs. That means meeting the individual needs of at least 7.9 billion people, as well as the collective needs of the societies they live in. If there is plenty of slack today, capital will no longer be the binding constraint for humanity going forward, as population growth is decelerating while technological progress is accelerating. 正如本书的标题所暗示的，我的一个基本主张是，世界上有足够的资本来满足每个人的需求。这意味着满足至少79亿人的个人需求，以及他们所处社会的集体需求。如果今天有大量的闲置资金，那么资本将不再是人类未来的约束性制约因素，因为人口增长正在减速，而技术进步正在加速。 It is tempting to look at this in terms of financial capital, but that would be giving in to the illusion of money. Dollar bills don’t feed people and gold bars can’t be used as smartphones. The capital that fundamentally matters is productive physical capital, such as machines and buildings. 从金融资本的角度来看待这个问题是很诱人的，但这将是向金钱的幻觉屈服。纸币不能养活人，金条不能作为智能手机使用。从根本上说，重要的资本是生产性实物资本，如机器和建筑物。 Financial capital is not irrelevant, of course – it is required for the initial construction of physical capital and to meet the ongoing needs of economic activity. If I want to build a factory or a store, I need to pay the construction workers and the suppliers of machines before I can start making money. And many businesses have ongoing expenses to pay each month before they can collect revenues from customers. When cash outflows precede cash inflows, a financing mechanism is required. To accumulate physical capital, we need to be able to accumulate financial capital. 当然，金融资本并非无关紧要--它是物质资本的初始建设和满足经济活动持续需求所需要的。如果我想建一个工厂或商店，在我开始赚钱之前，我需要支付建筑工人和机器供应商。而许多企业在向客户收取收入之前，每个月都有持续的开支需要支付。当现金流出大于现金流入时，就需要一个融资机制。为了积累物质资本，我们需要能够积累金融资本。 In the history of financial capital there have been many important innovations, and the introduction of marketplace lending has been an important recent one. The allocation of financial capital to projects through markets has been enormously successful, and it is the success of the market-based approach that has given us a large enough physical capital base to meet our basic needs. I should be quick to point out, as I have done elsewhere in the book, that the market-based approach relies on plenty of governmental activity, such as pro-competition regulation and the funding of education and research. 在金融资本的历史上，有许多重要的创新，而市场贷款的引入是最近的一个重要创新。通过市场将金融资本分配给项目的做法取得了巨大的成功，正是基于市场的方法的成功，使我们有足够大的物质资本基础来满足我们的基本需求。我应该迅速指出，正如我在书中其他地方所做的那样，基于市场的方法依赖于大量的政府活动，如支持竞争的监管，教育与研究的资助。 Many recent innovations in finance, however, rather than contributing to the creation and allocation of physical capital, have had the opposite effect, instead leading to the excessive ‘financialization’ of the economy. This refers to growth in financial activities that help generate personal wealth for some but that are decoupled from, or even harm, the formation of physical capital. One example of excess financialization is companies borrowing money to buy back shares instead of investing in innovation. The derivatives and structured securities, such as collateralized debt obligations (CDOs), that powered the housing bubble are another example. This is not to say that there are no potentially legitimate uses of these tools – it is just that they have grown far beyond what is needed for physical capital formation and taken on a life of their own. This can be seen both in the increased size of the financial sector as a proportion of the overall economy and in the wealth generated by making money from money instead of from productive capital (Lahart, 2011; Lewis, 2018). 然而，最近的许多金融创新非但没有促进物质资本的创造和配置，反而产生了相反的效果，反而导致了经济的过度 \"金融化\"。这指的是金融活动的增长，它有助于为一些人创造个人财富，但与物质资本的形成脱钩，甚至损害物质资本的形成。过度金融化的一个例子是公司借钱回购股票，而不是投资于创新。为房地产泡沫提供动力的衍生品和结构性证券，如抵押债务凭证（CDO），是另一个例子。这并不是说这些工具没有潜在的合法用途--只是它们的发展已经远远超出了实际资本形成的需要，并且有了自己的生命。这可以从金融部门在整体经济中的比例增加，以及从货币而不是生产性资本中赚钱所产生的财富中看出来（Lahart，2011；Lewis，2018）。 What is the role of ’human capital’ in all of this? I find this relatively new term to be a fundamental misnomer. Humans provide labor, and machines are capital. We saw earlier that, as Malthus had predicted, there was an exponential population explosion. As a result labor has not been a constraint on meeting our needs. That does not mean that we have not had labor shortages from time-to-time, but these have largely been the result of policy choices, such as restrictions on immigration or discriminatory access to education, rather than reflecting fundamentally scarce labor. “人力资本”在这一切中扮演了什么角色？我认为这个相对较新的术语是一个基本的误称。人类提供劳动力，而机器则是资本。我们前面看到，正如马尔萨斯所预测的那样，人口爆炸呈指数增长。因此，劳动力并不是满足我们需求的限制因素。这并不意味着我们从未经历过劳动力短缺，但这些短缺主要是政策选择的结果，比如限制移民或歧视性的教育准入，而不是根本上反映劳动力短缺。 The better question to ask is: what is the role of knowledge? The answer is that advances in knowledge are essential for making capital more effective. Even more fundamentally, physical capital cannot exist in the first place without knowledge. Take a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scanner, for example: you can’t build one without a great deal of knowledge of physics and engineering. However, in a world where everyone’s needs are taken care of, it might be possible to build the same machine without the need for financial capital, as you might not have to pay people in advance. And with enough knowledge, in the form of advanced robots, it will even be possible to build one without any ’human capital’ – labor – at all. 要问的更好的问题是：知识的作用是什么？答案是，知识的进步对于使资本更加有效至关重要。更为根本的是，没有知识，物质资本就无法存在。以磁共振成像（MRI）扫描仪为例：如果没有大量的物理学和工程学知识，你就无法建造一个。然而，在一个每个人的需求都得到照顾的世界里，也许有可能在不需要金融资本的情况下建造同样的机器，因为你可能不需要提前付钱给人。如果有足够的知识，以先进的机器人的形式，甚至有可能在没有任何 \"人力资本\"--劳动力--的情况下建造一个。 In conclusion here, we should realize that the accumulation of financial capital does not contribute to meeting our needs in and of itself. Imagine a Spanish galleon full of gold caught in a storm. Although the sailors aboard had ample access to financial capital, what they really needed to survive was either more knowledge or better physical capital. For example, if they had more knowledge of the weather, they could have circumnavigated the storm. Or if they had a stronger boat, they could have simply ridden it out. If anything, the gold is a hindrance to their survival – throwing it overboard might help the boat get away from the storm more quickly. 在此总结，我们应该认识到，金融资本的积累本身无助于满足我们的需求。想象一下，一艘满载黄金的西班牙大帆船遇到了风暴。虽然船上的水手们有充足的机会获得金融资本，但他们真正需要的是更多的知识或更好的物质资本来生存。例如，如果他们对天气有更多的了解，他们就能绕过风暴。或者，如果他们有一艘更强大的船，他们可以简单地渡过难关。如果有的话，黄金对他们的生存是一种阻碍--把它扔到海里可能有助于船更快地离开风暴。 We will now examine whether physical capital is sufficient to meet our needs. 我们现在将研究物质资本是否足以满足我们的需要。 Individual Needs 个人需求 My claim is that capital is no longer the binding constraint on our ability to meet our individual needs. This is especially true for the developed economies, but it is increasingly true globally. Let’s start by considering the needs emanating from keeping our bodies powered (see the Appendix for additional supporting information). 我的主张是，资本不再是对我们满足个人需求能力的约束性制约。这对发达经济体来说尤其如此，但它在全球范围内也越来越真实。让我们首先考虑保持我们的身体动力所产生的需求（见附录中的额外支持信息）。 Oxygen: There’s plenty of air for us to breathe; the key challenge is to make sure it is clean and safely breathable. China and India are both currently struggling with this, but they developed rapidly and are reliant on outdated energy sources. What is needed here are improvements to capital, such as switching to electric cars from internal combustion engine ones. 氧气： 有大量的空气供我们呼吸；关键的挑战是要确保空气的清洁和安全呼吸。中国和印度目前都在努力解决这个问题，但他们发展迅速，而且依赖过时的能源。这里需要的是对资本的改进，例如从内燃机汽车转为电动汽车。 Water: There’s plenty of water for everyone in the world to drink (the oceans are full of it). Though there are distribution and access problems, including in the United States (for example, the crisis of polluted drinking water in Flint, Michigan), physical capital is not a binding constraint. We are even able to build new desalination plants in record time. 水： 世界上有足够的水供每个人饮用（海洋里充满了水）。尽管存在分配和获取问题，包括在美国（例如，密歇根州弗林特市的饮用水污染危机），但物质资本并不是一个有约束力的制约因素。我们甚至能够在创纪录的时间内建造新的海水淡化厂。 Calories: We have made dramatic progress in farming: as a result of increased productivity, the rate of increase in the amount of land used globally to produce has plummeted, and the amount of land used worldwide for agriculture may have already peaked (Ramankutty et al., 2018; Ausubel et al., 2013). There have been significant recent breakthroughs in vertical farming, the practice of growing plants under controlled conditions, and in automated farming. For instance, one of the world’s largest vertical farms operates in Jersey City, and the Japanese indoor farming company Spread’s automated facility can produce 30,000 heads of lettuce per day (Harding, 2020). 卡路里： 我们在农业方面取得了巨大的进步：由于生产力的提高，全球用于生产的土地数量的增长速度急剧下降，全球用于农业的土地数量可能已经达到了顶峰（Ramankutty等人，2018；Ausubel等人，2013）。最近在垂直耕作（在受控条件下种植植物的做法）和自动化耕作方面取得了重大突破。例如，世界上最大的垂直农场之一在泽西市运营，日本室内农业公司Spread的自动化设施每天可以生产30,000头生菜（Harding，2020）。 Nutrients: This is primarily a question of knowledge, as we still don’t fully understand which nutrients the body really needs to ingest in what quantities. We obtain most of them from food, but depending on our diet we may need to add some supplements. The remaining amounts tend to be small, and we can produce plenty of them already (in developed countries, entire industries have sprung up trying to convince people to buy and consume food supplements that they do not need). 营养物质： 这主要是一个知识问题，因为我们仍然不完全了解身体真正需要摄入哪些营养物质的数量。我们从食物中获得大部分营养，但根据我们的饮食，我们可能需要添加一些补充剂。剩余的数量往往很少，而且我们已经可以生产很多了（在发达国家，整个行业已经兴起，试图说服人们购买和消费他们不需要的食品补充剂）。 Discharge: This is primarily addressed through modern sewage technology. Here too, capital is no longer a binding constraint, though its uneven distribution around the world is a problem. 排放： 这主要是通过现代污水处理技术来解决。在这里，资本也不再是一个有约束力的制约因素，尽管它在世界各地的分布不均衡是一个问题。 Now let’s consider the needs relating to the operating environment for humans. 现在让我们来考虑与人类操作环境有关的需求。 Temperature: The Chinese construction boom of the early 2000s illustrates how quickly we can build shelter, which, together with heating and air conditioning, is one crucial solution to our temperature needs. In the US, in the opening years of the 21st century, a construction boom was powered by artificially cheap mortgage credit. Though a lot of housing was built speculatively and remained empty, it powerfully demonstrated our construction capacity. Clothing is another strategy for meeting our temperature needs. The price of clothing has been falling in many parts of the world, including the United States. Capital is not a constraint here – indeed, we have the ability to clothe the world’s population many times over. 温度： 中国21世纪初的建筑热潮说明了我们能够多么迅速地建造住房，它与供暖和空调一起，是解决我们温度需求的一个重要办法。在美国，在21世纪的最初几年，建筑业的繁荣是由人为的廉价抵押贷款推动的。虽然很多住房是投机性建造的，仍然是空的，但它有力地证明了我们的建筑能力。服装是满足我们温度需求的另一个策略，在世界许多地方，包括美国，衣服的价格一直在下降。资本在这里不是一个制约因素--事实上，我们有能力为世界上的人口提供更多倍的衣服。 Pressure: Thankfully, we have nothing to do here, as we have plenty of space for humans to live in the right pressure range. This is a great example of a need that we do not consider much at all, but that would loom very large if land were to cease to be habitable and we had to go underwater or into space. 压力： 值得庆幸的是，我们在这里没有什么可做的，因为我们有足够的空间让人类在合适的压力范围内生活。这是一个很好的例子，说明我们根本没有过多地考虑这种需求，但如果陆地不再适合居住，我们不得不进入水下或太空，这种需求就会变得非常大。 Light: We have become very good at providing light. One study shows how the hours of light provided by 60 hours of labor in the United States exploded from around 10 in 1800 to over 100,000 by 1990 (Harford, 2017; Nordhaus, 1994). Since then, we have made considerable further progress with LED lighting. That progress has also come to other parts of the world, for instance in the form of off-grid, solar-powered lamps. 光： 我们已经非常擅长提供光线。一项研究显示，美国60小时的劳动可以提供的光照时间从1800年的约10小时增加到1990年的10万小时以上（Harford，2017；Nordhaus，1994）。自那时以来，LED照明技术取得了相当大的进步。这种进步也传播到了世界上其他地区，例如通过非电网太阳能灯的形式。 Finally we come to the more abstract individual needs. 最后，我们来谈谈更抽象的个人需求。 Healing: We often read that healthcare consumes an increasingly large fraction of the economy, especially in the United States, but that does not imply that capital is scarce. In industrialized countries we have plenty of hospital space and doctor’s offices. But, you may ask, didn’t the COVID-19 pandemic show that we didn’t have enough ICU beds? The answer is no: countries that reacted to the virus in good time stayed well within their capacity. Overall capital is sufficient for healing. We have extensive diagnostic facilities and are able to produce large quantities of medicine. 疗养： 我们经常读到，医疗保健在经济中的消耗越来越大，特别是在美国，但这并不意味着资本的稀缺。在工业化国家，我们有大量的医院空间和医生的办公室。但是，你可能会问，COVID-19的大流行不是表明我们没有足够的ICU床位吗？答案是否定的：及时对病毒作出反应的国家都在其能力范围内保持良好的状态。总的来说，资本是足够用来治疗的。我们有广泛的诊断设施，能够生产大量的药品。 Learning: Nor are we constrained by capital when it comes to learning. This is increasingly true not just in industrialized nations but also globally, due to the expansion of wireless networks and the increasing affordability of smartphones. We are not far away from reaching a point where we have enough capital for anyone in the world to learn anything that can be transmitted over the Internet; the binding constraint is the availability of affordable content and the time it takes to learn and teach. 学习： 在学习方面，我们也没有受到资本的限制。不仅在工业化国家，而且在全球范围内，由于无线网络的扩展和智能手机的日益廉价，这一点也越来越真实。我们离达到这样的程度并不遥远，即我们有足够的资本让世界上的任何人学习任何可以通过互联网传输的东西；具有约束力的制约因素是能否获得负担得起的内容以及学习所需的时间。 Meaning: The final individual need, that of meaning, is not and has never been constrained by capital. Capital plays no role in meeting our need for it. 意义： 个人的最终需求，即意义的需求，没有也从来没有受到资本的限制。资本在满足我们对它的需求方面没有发挥任何作用。 Collective Needs 集体需求 At first it might seem difficult to see how capital relates to our collective needs. How could it have anything to do with such abstract concepts as motivation and coordination? In discussing why capital is already sufficient today to meet our collective needs, I will also briefly point out how it was scarce with regard to these needs in the past. 起初，似乎很难看到资本与我们的集体需求有什么关系。它怎么可能与动机和协调这样的抽象概念有任何关系？在讨论为什么今天的资本已经足以满足我们的集体需求时，我还将简要地指出，在过去，资本在这些需求方面是如何匮乏的。 Reproduction: Available capital has always been sufficient for reproduction – otherwise, we wouldn’t be here today. 再生产： 可用的资本一直都足以进行繁殖--否则，我们就不会有今天了。 Allocation: During the Industrial Age the allocation of capital, such as where to build a factory and what it should produce, was the central allocation problem, and it was the scarcity of capital that made it difficult to meet this need. When there were few roads and other means of transportation, there were few places a factory could be built. Getting the place just right and building the right factory was thus a much harder problem than today where we can ship products around the world. As a result, the allocation problem for capital is no longer constrained by capital. And because capital is no longer scarce, it is also no longer the dominant allocation problem. As we will see in the next section, it has been replaced by the allocation of attention, for which capital is largely irrelevant. 分配： 在工业时代，资本的分配，如在哪里建厂，应该生产什么，是核心的分配问题，正是资本的稀缺性使得这一需求难以满足。当道路和其他运输工具很少的时候，可以建厂的地方也很少。因此，与今天我们可以将产品运往世界各地的情况相比，找到合适的地方并建造合适的工厂是一个难得多的问题。因此，资本的分配问题不再受制于资本。而且，由于资本不再稀缺，它也不再是主导的分配问题。正如我们将在下一节看到的，它已被注意力的分配所取代，而资本在很大程度上与此无关。 Motivation: Again, it might at first seem as if capital never played a role here. But consider what it was like to work in an early factory, when the outputs were generally not affordable for the workers. Workers at the time had to more or less be forced into factory work, a situation that still persists in some parts of the world for certain industries (e.g., clothing and hardware assembly). Contrast this with much of the period following the Second World War, when more advanced economies already had a fair bit of capital, making possible the mass production of goods that workers could afford. Motivation can of course come from many sources other than what wages can buy, such as wanting to help others (e.g. in healthcare) or facing an enemy (e.g. wartime production). The key point is that today motivation is no longer constrained by capital in principle. 动机： 同样，起初看起来似乎资本从未在这里发挥过作用。但想想在早期的工厂工作是什么样子的，当时的产出一般都是工人负担不起的。当时的工人不得不或多或少地被迫在工厂工作，这种情况在世界某些地区的某些行业（如服装和硬件组装）仍然存在。与此相比，二战后的大部分时间里，更先进的经济体已经拥有相当多的资本，使得大规模生产工人能够负担得起的商品成为可能。当然，动机可以来自工资所能购买的东西以外的许多来源，例如想要帮助他人（例如在医疗保健方面）或面对敌人（例如战时生产）。关键的一点是，今天的动机在原则上不再受到资本的限制。 Coordination: One of the primary ways to meet the need for coordination is through communication, which was heavily constrained by capital for the longest time. Today, however, we can hold a real-time video conference with nearly anybody in the world. And some of the big coverage gaps, such as parts of Africa, are rapidly being filled in. 协调： 满足协调需求的主要方式之一是通过通信，在很长一段时间里，通信受到资本的严重制约。然而今天，我们几乎可以与世界上的任何人举行实时视频会议。而一些大的覆盖空白，如非洲的部分地区，正在迅速被填补。 Knowledge: Finally, our collective need for knowledge was long constrained by capital. Making books, for instance, was expensive and time-consuming, and copies could only be made by humans, which introduced errors. The spread of knowledge was limited by the need to create and supply physical copies, constraints that we have now left behind. There were also other ways in which capital was scarce as far as knowledge was concerned. For instance, we had insufficient scientific instruments for inspecting matter, such as microscopes. Today, by contrast, we are able to build massive undertakings to support science, such as the Large Hadron Collider. 知识： 最后，我们对知识的集体需求长期受制于资本。例如，制作书籍既昂贵又费时，而且只能由人制作副本，这就会产生错误。知识的传播受制于创造和提供实体副本的需要，这些限制现在已经被我们抛在脑后。就知识而言，还有其他资本匮乏的方式。例如，我们没有足够的科学仪器来检查物质，如显微镜。相比之下，今天我们能够建立大规模的事业来支持科学，如大型强子对撞机。 Enablers 助推器 Our progress on the four foundational enablers – energy, resources, transformation and transportation – is another way to understand why capital is no longer scarce. There have been massive breakthroughs on all four during the Industrial Age. 我们在能源、资源、转型和运输这四个基础性推动因素上的进展，是理解为什么资本不再稀缺的另一种方式。在工业时代，这四个方面都取得了巨大的突破。 Energy: The biggest breakthrough in energy was the development of electricity, which allowed us to apply energy precisely. Our remaining challenges relate to the production, storage and distribution of electricity. Further improvements will let us meet different needs in new ways, but we are not fundamentally energy-constrained. For instance, at current efficiency rates, covering less than 0.1% of the Earth’s surface with solar panels could meet all of today’s energy needs (Berners-Lee, 2019). 能源： 能源方面最大的突破是电力的发展，它使我们能够精确地应用能源。我们剩下的挑战与电力的生产、储存和分配有关。进一步的改进将使我们以新的方式满足不同的需求，但我们并没有从根本上受到能源限制。例如，按照目前的效率，用太阳能电池板覆盖不到0.1%的地球表面就可以满足今天所有的能源需求（Berners-Lee，2019）。 Resources: The availability of resources was completely transformed during the Industrial Age through mining, which was enabled by innovation in transportation (railways) and energy (steam power). People who have concerns about sustainability sometimes point to the scarcity of resources as the primary constraint, but there are three sources that we can tap in the future: recycling, asteroid mining, and eventually transmutation (turning one element into another, as in the alchemists’ quest to turn lead into gold). For instance, a lot of electronics currently end up in landfill instead of being recycled, we achieved the first soft landing on an asteroid as far back as 2001, and we can already turn lithium into tritium. 资源： 在工业时代，通过采矿，资源的可用性被完全改变了，这是由运输（铁路）和能源（蒸汽动力）的创新促成的。对可持续发展有顾虑的人有时会指出资源的稀缺性是主要的制约因素，但我们在未来有三个来源可以利用：回收，小行星采矿，以及最终的转化（将一种元素转化为另一种元素，就像炼金术士将铅转化为金的追求）。例如，目前很多电子产品最终被填埋，而不是被回收，我们早在2001年就实现了在小行星上的首次软着陆，而且我们已经可以将锂变成氚。 Transformation: Our ability to transform materials also improved radically during the Industrial Age. For instance, chemistry enabled the synthetic production of rubber, which previously had to be harvested from trees. Machine tools enabled the rapid transformation of wood and metals. We later added transformation technologies such as injection molding and additive manufacturing technologies (often referred to as “3D printing”). 转化： 在工业时代，我们改造材料的能力也得到了彻底的提高。例如，化学使橡胶的合成生产成为可能，而以前橡胶必须从树上采摘。机器工具使木材和金属得以快速转化。后来，我们又增加了一些改造技术，如注射成型和增材制造技术（通常称为 \"3D打印\"）。 Transportation: Here we went from human-, animal- and wind-powered movement to machine-powered movement, dramatically increasing our capabilities. We can now fly across continents and oceans on commercial flights, reaching any major city in a single day, and there has been extraordinary progress in flight safety. While some have complained about a recent lack of progress, pointing to the lack of commercial supersonic options following the retirement of Concorde, work has recently resumed on developing new options for commercial supersonic flight. We have also made tremendous progress on reusable rockets and autonomous vehicles (for instance, drones and robots used in warehouses). 交通： 在这里，我们从人类、动物和风力驱动的运动变成了机器驱动的运动，极大地提高了我们的能力。我们现在可以通过商业航班飞越各大洲和大洋，在一天之内到达任何主要城市，而且在飞行安全方面有了非凡的进步。虽然有些人抱怨最近缺乏进展，指出协和飞机退役后缺乏商业超音速的选择，但最近已经恢复了开发商业超音速飞行新选择的工作。我们在可重复使用的火箭和自主车辆（例如，无人机和仓库中使用的机器人）方面也取得了巨大的进展。 The progress made on all these enablers has allowed us to produce more physical capital, to do so more rapidly and cheaply, and to transport it anywhere in the world. One illustration of how far we have come is the fact that smartphones only became available in 2000, but by 2017 there were over 2 billion smartphone users in the world. 在所有这些推动因素上取得的进展，使我们能够生产更多的实物资本，更迅速、更廉价地生产，并将其运送到世界任何地方。一个说明我们已经取得了多大成就的事实是，智能手机在2000年才开始使用，但到2017年，世界上有超过20亿智能手机用户。 I am not claiming that everyone’s needs are being met today, nor am I arguing that governments should be meeting people’s needs through government-run programs such as food stamps or subsidized housing – quite the opposite. My point is simply that physical capital is no longer the constraint when it comes to meeting our individual and collective needs. 我并不是说今天每个人的需求都得到了满足，也不是说政府应该通过政府管理的项目，如食品券或补贴住房来满足人们的需求--恰恰相反。我的观点是，当涉及到满足我们的个人和集体需求时，物质资本不再是制约因素。 The great success of capitalism is that capital is no longer scarce. However, we now face a scarcity of attention, and, as we will see, capitalism cannot and will not properly address that new scarcity without dramatic changes in how we regulate our society and ourselves. 资本主义的巨大成功在于，资本不再稀缺。然而，我们现在面临着注意力的稀缺，而且，正如我们将看到的，如果不对我们如何规范我们的社会和我们自己进行巨大的改变，资本主义根本不能妥善解决这种新的稀缺性。 "},"docs/Part_Three_Attention_Is_Scarce.html":{"url":"docs/Part_Three_Attention_Is_Scarce.html","title":"第三部分：注意力稀缺","keywords":"","body":"第三部分：注意力稀缺 In saying that attention is scarce, I mean that there is not enough of it available today to meet our needs. That’s what I set out to show in this part of the book. I’ll start by defining attention, before presenting several examples of needs that either are already no longer met due to a lack of attention, such as the need for meaning, or are at risk of not being met in the near future. After that, I will consider how much human attention is currently caught up in Industrial Age activities and how an increasing amount of attention is being trapped through our current uses of digital technology, such as advertising-based social networks. I will also discuss why market-based capitalism cannot be used to allocate attention. 说注意力稀缺，我的意思是，今天没有足够的注意力来满足我们的需要。这就是我在本书的这一部分所要说明的。我将从定义注意力开始，然后介绍几个需求的例子，这些需求要么已经因为缺乏注意力而不再被满足，比如对意义的需求，要么在不久的将来有可能不被满足。之后，我将考虑目前有多少人类的注意力被卷入工业时代的活动中，以及越来越多的注意力是如何通过我们目前对数字技术的使用被困住的，比如基于广告的社交网络。我还将讨论为什么基于市场的资本主义不能被用来分配注意力。 "},"docs/Part_Three_Attention_Is_Scarce/Attention.html":{"url":"docs/Part_Three_Attention_Is_Scarce/Attention.html","title":"注意力","keywords":"","body":"注意力 Attention is to time as velocity is to speed. If I tell you that I’m driving at a speed of 55 miles per hour, that does not tell you anything about where I’m going, because you don’t know what direction I’m heading in. Velocity is speed plus direction. Similarly, if I tell you that I spent two hours with my family yesterday (time), that does not tell you anything about what our minds were directed at—we could have been having an engaging conversation, or we could have been immersed in our phones. Attention is time plus intentionality. 注意力对时间的作用就像速度对速率的作用一样。如果我告诉你我正以每小时55英里的速度开车，这并不能告诉你我要去哪里，因为你不知道我在往哪个方向走。速度是速度加方向。同样，如果我告诉你我昨天和我的家人呆了两个小时（时间），这并不能告诉你我们的思想在干什么--我们可能在进行有吸引力的谈话，或者我们可能沉浸在手机里。注意力是时间加意向性。 The amount of human attention in the world is finite. We have 24 hours in the day, some of which we need to spend paying attention to eating, sleeping and meeting our other needs. The attention during the remaining hours of most people in the world is taken up by having to earn an income and by consuming goods and services, leaving relatively little time for attention to be freely allocated. A hard limit on available attention also exists for humanity as a whole—as I argued earlier, we are headed for peak population, at which point we will no longer be increasing the total amount of potentially available attention by adding more people. 人类在这个世界上的注意力是有限的。我们一天有24小时，其中一些时间我们需要用来注意吃饭、睡觉和满足我们的其他需求。世界上大多数人在剩下的时间里的注意力被必须赚取收入和消费商品和服务所占用，剩下相对较少的时间可以自由分配注意力。对整个人类来说，可用的注意力也有一个硬性的限制--正如我前面所说，我们正在走向人口高峰，到那时，我们将不再通过增加人口来增加潜在的可用注意力的总量。 Crucially, we cannot go back in time and change our past attention, either as individuals or collectively. A student who walks into an exam unprepared cannot revisit the preceding weeks and study more. A world that enters a pandemic unprepared is not able to go back in time and do more research on coronaviruses. 至关重要的是，我们无法回到过去改变我们过去的注意力，无论是个体还是集体。一个没有准备好步入考场的学生无法回到前几周再多学习一些。一个没有准备好迎接大流行的世界也无法回到过去，对冠状病毒进行更多的研究。 Individual Attention Scarcity 个人关注的稀缺性 First, let’s consider attention at the individual level. The need for meaning is no longer being met because most people are failing to give enough attention to the crucial questions of purpose at a time of great transition. 首先，让我们考虑一下个人层面上的关注。对意义的需求不再得到满足，因为大多数人在大转型时期未能对目的的关键问题给予足够的关注。 In recent times, all over the world, people had become used to constructing meaning around their jobs and beliefs, but both are undermined by digital technologies. Many jobs have come under pressure from automation or outsourcing. Meanwhile, ideas, images, and information are no longer contained by geographic boundaries, and people are increasingly exposed to opinions and behaviors that diverge from their core beliefs. In combination, these challenges are leading to a crisis of identity and meaning. This crisis can take many different forms, including teenage depression, adult suicide—in the US, particularly among middle-aged white men —and fatal drug overdoses (Rodrick, 2019; American Foundation for Suicide Prevention, 2019). Between 2006 and 2019, these problems increased by 99 percent, 26 percent and 43 percent respectively. 近来，在世界各地，人们已经习惯于围绕他们的工作和信仰构建意义，但这两者都被数字技术所破坏。许多工作都受到了自动化或外包的压力。同时，思想、图像和信息不再受到地理边界的限制，人们越来越多地接触到与他们的核心信仰不同的观点和行为。这些挑战结合在一起，导致了身份和意义的危机。这种危机可以有许多不同的形式，包括青少年抑郁症、成人自杀--在美国，特别是在中年白人男子中--以及致命的药物过量（罗德里克，2019；美国预防自杀基金会，2019）。2006年至2019年期间，这些问题分别增加了99%、26%和43%。 ​​ Crisis Statistics Source: CDC, 2020; National Center for Health Statistics, 2019; Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, 2020 The situation is not dissimilar to the one that first occurred when people left the countryside and moved to big cities during the transition to the Industrial Age, having to give up identities that had been constructed around land and crafts (a process that has continued to play itself out throughout the world as industrialization spread). They were uprooted from their extended families and confronted with people from other regions who held different beliefs. Then too there was a marked increase in mental illness, drug abuse and suicide. 这种情况与人们在向工业时代过渡期间离开农村并迁往大城市时首次出现的情况并无二致，他们不得不放弃围绕土地和手工艺构建的身份（随着工业化的蔓延，这一过程在世界各地不断上演）。他们离开了自己的大家庭，与来自其他地区、持有不同信仰的人打交道。然后，精神疾病、药物滥用和自杀的情况也明显增加。 The Industrial Age had little use for an individual sense of meaning—it is difficult to combine the pursuit of a strong sense of personal purpose with the repetitive operation of an industrial machine day in, day out. Early in the Industrial Age, religion continued to provide a source of meaning for most people, as a collective purpose. As the Industrial Age progressed, however, church attendance decreased, while jobs and consumption increasingly came to be seen as sources of meaning. Some of this change can be traced back to the rise of the ‘Protestant work ethic‘, which provided justification for wealth accumulation from rising professions (such as lawyers and doctors) and the managerial class. Some of it is the result of the massive growth in commercial advertising, which cleverly tied consumption to such aspirations as freedom (e.g., the infamous Camel cowboy cigarette ads) and happiness. We have come so far on that path that people now speak of “retail therapy,” the idea that you can make yourself feel better by shopping. 工业时代对个人的意义感没有什么用处--很难将追求强烈的个人目的感与日复一日的工业机器的重复操作结合起来。在工业时代早期，宗教作为一种集体目的，继续为大多数人提供意义的来源。然而，随着工业时代的发展，去教堂的人减少了，而工作和消费越来越被视为意义的来源。这种变化有些可以追溯到 \"新教工作伦理 \"的兴起，它为正在崛起的职业（如律师和医生）和管理阶层的财富积累提供了理由。其中一些是商业广告大规模增长的结果，它巧妙地将消费与自由（例如臭名昭著的骆驼牌牛仔香烟广告）和幸福等愿望联系起来。我们在这条道路上走得如此之远，以至于人们现在谈论 \"零售疗法\"，认为你可以通过购物使自己感觉更好。 As with such earlier transitions, it is not surprising that with the current digital dislocation we are yet again seeing a rise in populist leaders with simplistic messages, such as Donald Trump in the United States and Viktor Orbán in Hungary. A recent study found that the average share of the vote for populist parties throughout Europe is more than double what it was in the 1960s (Inglehart & Norris, 2016). People who lose their sense of meaning when their purpose and beliefs are challenged want to be told that things will be okay and that the answers are simple. “Make America Great Again” is one such message. These backward-looking movements promise an easy return to a glorious past. Similarly, we are once again seeing a growth in church attendance as well as in various spiritual movements, all of which promise to quickly restore individuals’ access to meaning. The alternative of creating new meaning through an individual search for purpose and the independent examination and formation of beliefs requires considerable attention. Attention which people cannot muster for reasons that we will examine in detail later in the book. 与早期的这种过渡一样，随着当前的数字失调，我们再次看到了具有简单化信息的民粹主义领导人的崛起，如美国的唐纳德-特朗普和匈牙利的维克多-欧尔班，这一点并不令人惊讶。最近的一项研究发现，整个欧洲民粹主义政党的平均得票率是1960年代的两倍多（Inglehart & Norris, 2016）。当他们的目的和信仰受到挑战时，失去意义感的人希望被告知事情会好起来，答案很简单。\"让美国再次伟大 \"就是这样一个信息。这些向后看的运动承诺可以轻松回到辉煌的过去。同样地，我们再次看到教堂出席率以及各种精神运动的增长，所有这些都承诺迅速恢复个人对意义的获取。通过个人对目的的寻求以及对信仰的独立审查和形成来创造新的意义，这种选择需要相当的关注。由于我们将在本书后面详细研究的原因，人们无法凝聚起注意力。 This individual scarcity of attention to purpose is not confined to any one demographic. People who work multiple jobs to pay rent and feed their families are definitely impacted, but so are many people in high-paying jobs, who are often working more hours than ever and have increased their personal expenses to the point where they cannot afford to quit. One might posit that this is the result of a lack of education, but I often meet young people who have graduated from elite schools and want to work for a technology startup or get into venture capital. Most of them are looking for advice about how to apply to a specific position. After discussing that for some time, I usually ask them a more open question: “What do you want from this position?” That often elicits more interesting answers—they might talk about learning a new skill, or applying one that they have recently learned. Sometimes people answer with a desire to contribute to some cause. When I ask them “What is your purpose?”, shockingly few have paid enough attention to this question to have an answer. It is often as if they had been presented with this question for the first time and suddenly realize that “make a lot of money” is not actually a purpose that can provide meaning in life. 这种对目的的个人稀缺性并不局限于任何一个人口群体。为了支付房租和养家糊口而从事多份工作的人肯定会受到影响，但许多从事高薪工作的人也是如此，他们的工作时间往往比以往更长，个人开支也增加到无法辞职的地步。有人可能会认为这是缺乏教育的结果，但我经常遇到那些从名校毕业的年轻人，他们想在科技创业公司工作或进入风险投资。他们中的大多数人都在寻找关于如何申请特定职位的建议。在讨论了一段时间后，我通常会问他们一个更开放的问题： \"你想从这个职位上得到什么？\" 这往往会引出更有趣的答案--他们可能会谈论学习新技能，或应用他们最近学到的技能。有时人们的回答是希望为某些事业做出贡献。当我问他们 \"你的目的是什么？\"时，令人震惊的是，很少有人对这个问题给予足够的重视，以至于没有答案。他们往往是第一次被问到这个问题，突然意识到 \"赚大钱 \"实际上并不是一个可以提供生活意义的目的。 Collective Attention Scarcity 集体注意的稀缺性 Humanity is also not devoting nearly enough attention to our collective need for more knowledge to address the threats we are facing and seize the opportunities ahead of us. 人类也没有对我们对更多知识的集体需求投入足够的关注，以应对我们所面临的威胁并抓住我们面前的机会。 In terms of the threats we face, we are not working nearly hard enough on reducing the levels of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Or on monitoring asteroids that could strike the Earth, and coming up with ways of deflecting them. Or on containing the current coronavirus outbreak and future pandemics (an early draft of The World After Capital, written before 2020, said “containing the next avian flu” here). 就我们面临的威胁而言，我们在降低大气层中的二氧化碳和其他温室气体水平方面的工作还远远不够。或者监测可能袭击地球的小行星，并想出偏转它们的方法。或者在遏制目前的冠状病毒爆发和未来的大流行病上（《资本后的世界》*的早期草案，写于2020年之前，这里说 \"遏制下一次禽流感\"）。 Climate change, “death from above” and pandemics are three examples of species-level threats that are facing humans. As I wrote earlier, we are only able to sustain the current global human population due to technological progress. Each of these risk categories has the potential to fundamentally disrupt our ability to meet individual needs. For example, the climate crisis could result in large-scale global crop failures, which could mean we would no longer be able meet everyone’s needs for calories and nutrients. This is not a hypothetical concern: it has led to the downfall of prior human civilizations, such as the Rapa Nui on Easter Island and the Mayans, whose societies collapsed due to relatively small changes in their local climate, possibly induced in some measure by their own actions (White, 2019; Simon, 2020; Seligson, 2019). Now we are facing a climate crisis on a truly global scale, and we should be using a significant proportion of all human attention to fight this threat. 气候变化、\"来自上面的死亡 \"和大流行病是人类面临的物种级威胁的三个例子。正如我之前写的，由于技术进步，我们只能维持目前的全球人类人口。这些风险类别中的每一个都有可能从根本上扰乱我们满足个人需求的能力。例如，气候危机可能导致大规模的全球作物歉收，这可能意味着我们将不再能够满足每个人对卡路里和营养物质的需求。这不是一个假设性的担忧：它已经导致了之前人类文明的衰落，如复活节岛的拉帕努伊人和玛雅人，他们的社会由于当地气候相对较小的变化而崩溃，可能在某种程度上是由他们自己的行为引起的（White，2019；Simon，2020；Seligson，2019）。现在，我们正面临着真正的全球规模的气候危机，我们应该用人类所有注意力的很大一部分来对抗这一威胁。 On the opportunity side, far too little human attention is spent on things such as environmental cleanup, educational resources and basic research. The list here is nearly endless, and includes unlocking quantum computing and advancing machine intelligence. The latter is particularly intriguing because it could help produce more knowledge faster, thus potentially helping to reduce the scarcity of attention. 在机会方面，人类在环境清理、教育资源和基础研究等方面的关注太少。这里的清单几乎是无穷无尽的，包括解锁量子计算和推进机器智能。后者特别引人注意，因为它可以帮助更快地产生更多的知识，从而有可能帮助减少注意力的稀缺性。 None of this means that everyone has to become a scientist or engineer—there are many other ways to allocate attention to address these threats and opportunities. For instance, learning about the climate crisis, sharing that knowledge with others and becoming politically active are all ways of allocating attention that can directly or indirectly create more knowledge. So is creating art that inspires others, whether it is to directly take an action, or by connecting us to our shared humanity as a source of meaning. This is why when I talk about not creating enough knowledge, I am not limiting it to scientific knowledge but including all knowledge, as defined earlier. 这并不意味着每个人都必须成为科学家或工程师--还有许多其他方式来分配注意力，以应对这些威胁和机会。例如，学习关于气候危机的知识，与他人分享这些知识，并成为政治上的积极分子，都是分配注意力的方式，可以直接或间接地创造更多的知识。创作激发他人的艺术也是如此，无论是直接采取某种行动，还是通过将我们与我们共同的人性联系起来作为意义的来源。这就是为什么当我谈到没有创造足够的知识时，我并不局限于科学知识，而是包括前面定义的所有知识。 Attention scarcity is difficult to alleviate, and I therefore propose it as a possible explanation for the Fermi paradox. The physicist Enrico Fermi famously asked why we have not yet detected any signs of intelligent life elsewhere in our universe, despite knowing that there are plenty of planets that could harbor such life. Many different explanations have been advanced, including that we are the first and hence only intelligent species, or that more advanced intelligent species stay “dark” for fear of being attacked by even more advanced species (the premise of Cixin Liu’s sci-fi trilogy The Three-Body Problem). Alternatively, perhaps all civilizations develop until they have sufficient capital but then suffer from attention scarcity, so they are quickly wiped out by a pandemic or a meteor strike. If civilizations that can build radios don’t persist for very long, the timing of signs of their existence may be very unlikely to coincide with ours. 注意力稀缺是很难缓解的，因此我提出它是对费米悖论的一种可能解释。物理学家恩里科-费米（Enrico Fermi）提出了一个著名的问题：尽管我们知道有很多星球可能孕育着智能生命，但为什么我们还没有在宇宙的其他地方检测到任何智能生命的迹象。许多不同的解释已经被提出，包括我们是第一个，因此也是唯一的智能物种，或者更先进的智能物种保持 \"黑暗\"，因为害怕被更先进的物种攻击（刘慈欣的科幻三部曲三体问题的前提）。或者，也许所有的文明都发展到拥有足够的资本，但随后却遭受到注意力的稀缺，所以它们很快就被一场大流行病或流星撞击消灭了。如果能够建造无线电的文明不能持续很长时间，它们存在的迹象与我们的时间重合的可能性非常小。 Why is our scarce attention so poorly allocated that we have created a potential extinction-level event in the form of a climate crisis? One reason is that we currently use the market mechanism to allocate attention. The next sections explain how this mechanism is sucking huge amounts of attention into a few systems such as Facebook, while also keeping much of it trapped in Industrial Age activities. Finally, we will consider why markets fundamentally cannot allocate attention, which points to crucial limits of capitalism. 为什么我们稀缺的注意力分配得如此糟糕，以至于我们以气候危机的形式创造了一个潜在的灭绝级事件？其中一个原因是，我们目前使用市场机制来分配注意力。接下来的章节将解释这一机制是如何将大量的注意力吸进少数几个系统，如Facebook，同时也将大部分注意力困在工业时代的活动中。最后，我们将考虑为什么市场从根本上不能分配注意力，这指出了资本主义的关键限制。 "},"docs/Part_Three_Attention_Is_Scarce/Misallocation.html":{"url":"docs/Part_Three_Attention_Is_Scarce/Misallocation.html","title":"错配","keywords":"","body":"错配 We have seen that attention is scarce relative to the great problems and opportunities facing us, making proper allocation of available attention the crucial challenge for humanity. As we will see later, digital technology can help meet this challenge. But in the recent past the primary effect of digital technology has been to misallocate attention. 我们已经看到，相对于我们面临的巨大问题和机会，注意力是稀缺的，这使得适当分配可用的注意力成为人类的关键挑战。正如我们将在后面看到的，数字技术可以帮助应对这一挑战。但在最近，数字技术的主要影响是错误地分配注意力。 The Internet is exponentially increasing the amount of available content. Most of the recorded content produced by humanity has been produced in the last few years, a natural result of fast exponential growth in the creation of data (Marr, 2019). As a result, it is easy to be overwhelmed. Our limited attention is easily absorbed by the increasing amount of content tailored to piquing our curiosity and capturing our attention. Humans are inadequately adapted to the information environment we now live in. Checking email, Twitter, Instagram, and watching yet another YouTube clip or Snapchat story provide ‘information hits’ that trigger the parts of our brain that evolved to be stimulated by novelty, social connection, sexual attractiveness, animal cuteness, and so on. For hundreds of thousands of years, when you saw a cat (or a sexy person) there was an actual cat (or sexy person) somewhere nearby. Now the Internet can provide you with an effectively unlimited stream of cat (or sexy person) pictures. In 2019, the average person spent nearly two and a half hours on social media every day, part of a staggering 10 and a half hours spent on some sort of media consumption, or more than 60 percent of all waking hours (Kemp, 2020; \"The Nielsen Total Audience Report,\" 2020). 互联网正以指数形式增加可用内容的数量。人类生产的大部分记录内容都是在过去几年里产生的，这是数据创造快速指数增长的自然结果（Marr，2019）。因此，我们很容易被淹没。我们有限的注意力很容易被越来越多为激起我们的好奇心和吸引我们的注意力而定制的内容所吸收。人类没有充分适应我们现在生活的信息环境。检查电子邮件、Twitter、Instagram，以及观看另一个YouTube短片或Snapchat故事，这些都提供了 \"信息点击\"，触发了我们大脑中的某些部分，这些部分在进化过程中被新奇、社会联系、性吸引力、动物的可爱所刺激，等等。几十万年来，当你看到一只猫（或一个性感的人），附近就有一只真实的猫（或性感的人）。现在，互联网可以为你提供有效的无限的猫（或性感的人）图片流。2019年，平均每人每天在社交媒体上花费近两个半小时，这是花费在某种媒体消费上的惊人的10个半小时的一部分，或超过所有清醒时间的60%（坎普，2020；\"尼尔森总受众报告\"，2020）。 Importantly, the dominant companies that we use to access this information, such as Google, Facebook and Twitter, generate most of their revenues by capturing and reselling our attention. That’s the essence of advertising, which is their business model. Advertisers literally buy our attention. Today, in order to grow, these companies invest in algorithms designed to present highly targeted, captivating content, thereby capturing more of our attention. News sites like Buzzfeed and the Huffington Post do the same. 重要的是，我们用来获取这些信息的主导公司，如谷歌、脸书和推特，通过捕捉和转售我们的注意力获得了大部分收入。这就是广告的本质，这也是他们的商业模式。广告商实际上是在购买我们的注意力。今天，为了发展，这些公司投资于旨在呈现高度针对性、吸引人的内容的算法，从而吸引我们更多的注意力。像Buzzfeed和Huffington Post这样的新闻网站也是如此。 It is much easier to capture attention by appealing to the parts of our brain that find kittens cute, people sexy, and react with outrage to perceived offenses rather than asking us to read a long-form essay or work through an argument by independently weighing evidence. The companies responsible for these systems lack financial incentives to persuade you to close your computer, put down your smartphone and spend more time with family and friends, read a book, or go outdoors and enjoy, or even clean up, the environment. The financial markets closely track metrics such as number of users and time spent on a platform, which are predictors of future growth in advertising revenue. In other words, the markets that drive the predominant way we use digital technology to allocate attention reflect the financial interests of investors and advertisers, which are often orthogonal or even antagonistic to individual and community interests. As we will see later (see the section on “Missing Prices” below) the problem runs even deeper, as it is actually impossible to construct proper markets for attention. 通过吸引我们大脑中认为小猫可爱、人们性感以及对感知到的冒犯作出愤怒反应的部分，而不是要求我们阅读一篇长篇文章或通过独立权衡证据来解决一个论点，来吸引注意力要容易得多。负责这些系统的公司缺乏经济激励，无法说服你关闭电脑，放下智能手机，花更多时间与家人和朋友在一起，读一本书，或到户外享受，甚至清理环境。金融市场密切跟踪用户数量和在一个平台上花费的时间等指标，这些都是预测未来广告收入增长的指标。换句话说，推动我们使用数字技术分配注意力的市场行为，反映了投资者和广告商的经济利益，而这些利益往往与个人和社区的利益正交，甚至是对立的。正如我们稍后将看到的（见下文 \"缺失的价格 \"一节），问题甚至更深，因为实际上不可能构建适当的注意力市场。 "},"docs/Part_Three_Attention_Is_Scarce/Trapped.html":{"url":"docs/Part_Three_Attention_Is_Scarce/Trapped.html","title":"困境","keywords":"","body":"困境 While digital technology is being used to capture rapidly increasing amounts of our attention, we should also consider what the bulk of attention is dedicated to today. Not surprisingly, since we are just beginning to transition out of it, the vast bulk of human attention is focused on Industrial Age activities, in particular labor and consumption. For example, in the US many people spend 40 or more hours a week on the job, which amounts to 35 per cent of waking hours (assuming eight hours of sleep per night). People in the US now spend around 10 and a half hours a day consuming media (including traditional television and radio in addition to Facebook, YouTube, Netflix and similar services, podcasts, games, and more), which (setting aside simultaneous usage) amounts to over 60 per cent of waking time (\"The Nielsen Total Audience Report,\" 2020). To understand why so much of our attention is spoken for, I present the concept of the “job loop.” 虽然数字技术被用来捕捉我们迅速增加的注意力，但我们也应该考虑今天大部分的注意力都用在什么地方。不足为奇的是，由于我们刚刚开始向工业时代过渡，人类的大部分注意力都集中在工业时代的活动上，尤其是劳动和消费。例如，在美国，许多人每周花40小时或更多的时间在工作上，这相当于清醒时间的35%（假设每晚有8小时的睡眠）。在美国，人们现在每天花大约10个半小时消费媒体（除了Facebook、YouTube、Netflix和类似服务、播客、游戏等，还包括传统电视和广播），这（抛开同时使用）相当于超过60%的清醒时间（\"尼尔森总观众报告\"，2020年）。为了理解为什么我们的注意力如此被占据，我提出了“工作循环”的概念。 The Job Loop 工作循环 Thinking dispassionately about labor is hard, because over the last couple of centuries we have become convinced that employment is essential to both the economy and individual dignity. Let’s start from the perspective of production. If you want to make products or deliver a service, you require a series of inputs, including buildings and machines (capital), raw materials or parts (supplies), and human workers (labor). For much of history, capital and labor have been complementary: as the owner of a company, you couldn’t use your physical capital without having labor to operate it. That was true for manufacturing and even more so for services, which often use little capital and consist primarily of labor. 冷静地思考劳动问题是很难的，因为在过去的几个世纪中，我们已经确信就业对经济和个人尊严都是至关重要的。让我们从生产的角度开始。如果你想制造产品或提供服务，你需要一系列的投入，包括建筑物和机器（资本），原材料或零件（用品），以及人类工人（劳动）。在历史上的大部分时间里，资本和劳动是互补的：作为一个公司的所有者，如果没有劳动力来操作，你就无法使用你的物质资本。制造业如此，服务行业更是如此，因为服务行业往往很少使用资本，主要由劳动力组成。 However, there is nothing in economics that says that all production processes should require labor. The opposite idea is an artifact of the production functions that were technologically available when economists developed the theory of production. If company owners are able to figure out how to do something cheaper or better by using less or no labor, that’s what they will choose to do. When it was acquired by Facebook for $19 billion, for example, WhatsApp had fewer than 50 employees. 然而，经济学中没有任何内容说所有的生产过程都应该需要劳动。相反的想法是经济学家发展生产理论时技术上可用的生产函数的一个伪命题。如果公司老板能够想出如何通过使用更少或不使用劳动力来做更便宜或更好的事情，这就是他们会选择做的。例如，当它被Facebook以190亿美元收购时，WhatsApp的员工不到50人。 Having no labor at all might make sense for a single company, but it does not for the economy as a whole as it is currently constructed. Who will buy goods and services produced by automated systems if people are unemployed and don’t have any money? Walter Reuther, head of the United Automobile Workers union in the 1950s, often told a story about an exchange he had with an official of the Ford motor company (who, as the story became famous in its own right, became Henry Ford II): 完全没有劳动力可能对单个公司有意义，但对目前构建的整个经济来说是没有意义的。如果人们失业，没有钱，谁会购买自动化系统生产的商品和服务？沃尔特-卢瑟是20世纪50年代联合汽车工人工会的负责人，他经常讲述他与福特汽车公司的一位官员（这个故事本身就很有名，后来成为亨利-福特二世）的交流故事： Ford official: How are you going to collect union dues from these guys [robots]? Walter Reuther: How are you going to get them to buy Fords? (O'Toole, 2011) 福特官员：你打算如何向这些家伙[机器人]收取工会会费？沃尔特-鲁瑟： 你打算如何让他们购买福特汽车？(O'Toole, 2011) If we all had inherited wealth or sufficient income from capital, an economy without labor would not be a problem, and we could enjoy the benefits of cheaper products and services courtesy of robots and automation. 如果我们都有继承的财富或足够的资本收入，没有劳动力的经济将不是一个问题，我们可以享受机器人和自动化带来的更便宜产品和服务的好处。 The possibility of a slump in consumer demand due to less labor long seemed not just unlikely but impossible. There was a virtuous loop at the heart of economic growth: the ‘job loop.’ 由于劳动力减少导致消费需求下降的可能性长期以来似乎不仅不太可能，而且几乎是不可能的。经济增长的核心是一个良性循环：即“工作循环”。 In today’s economy, the majority of people sell their labor, producing goods and services and receiving wages in return. With their wages, they buy smartphones, books, tools, houses and cars. They also buy the professional assistance of attorneys, doctors, car mechanics, gardeners and hair stylists. 在今天的经济中，大多数人出售他们的劳动，生产商品和服务，并获得工资作为回报。他们用自己的工资购买智能手机、书籍、工具、房屋和汽车。他们还购买律师、医生、汽车修理工、园丁和发型师的专业协助。 Most of the people who sell these goods and services are in turn employed, meaning that they too sell their labor and buy goods and services from other people with what they are paid. And round and round it goes. 大多数出售这些商品和服务的人反过来也被雇用，这意味着他们也出售自己的劳动力，用他们得到的报酬向其他人购买商品和服务。就这样周而复始。 ​​ The Job Loop The job loop worked incredibly well in combination with competitive markets for goods and services and with a properly functioning financial system. Entrepreneurs either used debt or equity to start new businesses, and employed people at wages that were often higher than older businesses, increasing their employees’ purchasing power and thereby fueling further innovation and growth. As far as expanding economic production and solving problems for which markets are well-suited, it was a virtuous cycle that resulted in unprecedented prosperity and innovation. 在商品和服务的竞争性市场以及正常运作的金融系统的配合下，就业循环的效果令人难以置信。企业家们利用债务或股权开办新企业，并以通常高于老企业的工资雇用员工，增加员工的购买力，从而推动进一步的创新和增长。就扩大经济生产和解决市场很适合的问题而言，这是一个良性循环，带来了前所未有的繁荣和创新。 Some might point out that many people these days are self-employed, but that is irrelevant if they are selling their time. For instance, a graphic designer who works as an independent contractor is still paid for the labor they put into a project. It is only if they design something that is paid for over and over without them spending further time on it, such as a graphics template, that they have the opportunity to leave the job loop. 有些人可能会指出，现在很多人都是自营职业者，但如果他们是在出售自己的时间，这就不重要了。例如，作为独立承包商的平面设计师仍然要为他们在项目中投入的劳动付出代价。只有当他们设计的东西，在他们没有进一步花费时间的情况下被反复支付，如图形模板，他们才有机会离开这个工作圈。 There are multiple problems with this virtuous cycle today. First, as we calculated at the outset of this section, it traps the vast majority of human attention. Second, when things contract, the effect of mutual reinforcement applies in the other direction. Take a small town, for example, in which local stores provide some of the employment. If a big superstore comes into town, total retail employment and wages will both fall. Fewer store employees have income, and those who do have less. If they start to spend less on haircuts and car repairs, the hair stylist and car mechanic earn less and can spend less themselves, and so on. Third, much of the consumption today is driven by vast sums of money spent on advertising, as well as by exposure to social media, inducing people into positional spending on wants (e.g., a bigger car than their neighbor). These higher expenditure levels, in turn, lock people into jobs which they hate but cannot afford to leave, which explains a great deal of the frustration among relatively highly-paid professionals, such as lawyers and bankers. 今天，这种良性循环存在着多种问题。首先，正如我们在本节开始时计算的那样，它困住了人类绝大部分的注意力。第二，当事物收缩时，相互强化的效果在另一个方向上适用。以一个小镇为例，当地的商店提供了一些就业机会。如果一家大型超级市场进入小镇，零售业的总就业人数和工资都会下降。更少的商店员工有收入，而那些有收入的人则更少。如果他们开始减少在理发和修车上的消费，那么发型师和修车工的收入就会减少，他们自己也可以减少消费，如此循环。第三，今天的大部分消费是由花在广告上的巨额资金以及对社交媒体的接触所驱动的，诱使人们对需求进行定位消费（例如，比邻居更大的汽车）。这些较高的支出水平反过来又将人们锁定在他们讨厌但又无力离开的工作中，这就解释了相对高薪的专业人士，如律师和银行家的大量挫败感。 Put differently, what was once a virtuous loop has become a vicious loop that holds much of human attention trapped. Much of The World After Capital is about breaking free of this vicious version of the job loop. That is an urgent problem as the job loop has been becoming more vicious for some time now due to a change in the relationship between labor and capital. 换句话说，曾经的良性循环已经变成了一个恶性循环，把人类的大部分注意力困住了。《资本后的世界》的大部分内容是关于挣脱这种恶性的工作循环。这是一个紧迫的问题，因为一段时间以来，由于劳动和资本之间关系的变化，工作循环已经变得更加恶性。 The Great Decoupling 大脱钩 To understand what is happening to the job loop, we need to look at a change in the economy that has become known as “the Great Decoupling” (Bernstein & Raman, 2015). In the decades after Worl War II, as the US economy grew, the share of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) going to labor grew at the same rate. However, starting in the mid-1970s, GDP continued to grow while household income remained flat (Economic Policy Institute, n.d.). 为了了解就业圈发生了什么，我们需要看看经济中的一个变化，这个变化被称为 \"大脱钩\"（Bernstein & Raman，2015）。在二战后的几十年里，随着美国经济的增长，国内生产总值（GDP）中用于劳动的份额也在同步增长。然而，从20世纪70年代中期开始，国内生产总值继续增长，而家庭收入保持平稳（经济政策研究所，n.d.）。 ​​ The Great Decoupling Source: Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, 2021a Over this time of stagnant incomes, and particularly from the mid-1980s onward, US GDP growth was increasingly financed by consumers going into debt, until we reached the limit of how much debt households could support. The first event that really drove that point home was the collapse of the US housing bubble. There is some evidence that we are hitting another such point right now, as a result of the COVID-19 crisis, which has led to dramatic increases in unemployment. 在收入停滞的这段时间里，特别是从80年代中期开始，美国的GDP增长越来越多地由消费者举债来支撑，直到我们达到了家庭能够支持的债务的极限。真正使这一点成为现实的第一个事件是美国房地产泡沫的崩溃。有一些证据表明，我们现在正遇到另一个这样的点，由于COVID-19危机，这导致了失业率的大幅上升。 ​​ Household Debt to GDP for United States Source: Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, 2021b; 2021c Similar changes have occurred in other developed economies. This decoupling may be partly accounted for by changing demographics, but the primary driver appears to be technology. As technological innovation accelerates, there will be further pressure on the job loop. Particularly worrisome is the fact that jobs in developing countries are highly exposed to automation (The Economist, 2016). As a result, these countries may either skip the “golden age of the job loop” entirely or have a much diminished version. 其他发达经济体也发生了类似的变化。这种脱钩可能部分原因是人口结构的变化，但主要驱动力似乎是技术。随着技术革新的加速，就业圈将面临进一步的压力。特别令人担忧的是，发展中国家的工作高度暴露于自动化（The Economist，2016）导致这些国家可能会完全跳过 \"就业循环的黄金时代\"，或者有一个大大减少的版本。 So, while we want to free up the attention trapped in the job loop, we need to figure out how to do so gradually, rather than through a rapid collapse. But is such a collapse even possible? 因此，虽然我们想释放被困在工作循环中的注意力，但我们需要弄清楚如何逐步做到这一点，而不是通过快速崩溃。但这样的崩溃是否可能发生？ Lump of Labor or Magic Employment Fallacy? 劳动力总量或神奇的就业谬误？ With the job loop still dominant, people have to sell their labor to earn a living. Until recently, most economists believed that when human labor is replaced by technology in one economic activity, it finds work in another part. These economists refer to a fear of technological unemployment or underemployment as the “lump of labor fallacy.“ 在工作循环仍然占主导地位的情况下，人们必须出售劳动力来谋生。直到最近，大多数经济学家都认为，当人类劳动力在某个经济活动中被技术所取代时，它会在其他领域找到工作。这些经济学家将对技术引起的失业或低就业的担忧称为“劳动力总量谬误”。 The argument is that automating some part of the economy frees up labor to work on something else—entrepreneurs might use this newly available labor to deliver innovative new products and services, for example. There is no fixed “lump” of labor; rather there are potentially an infinite number of things to work on. After all, this is what has happened historically. Why should this time be different? 这个论点是，经济的某些部分实现自动化后，可以释放出劳动力来从事其他工作--例如，企业家可以利用这些新的可用劳动力来提供创新的新产品和服务。没有固定的 \"一揽子 \"劳动力；相反，有可能有无限多的事情可以做。毕竟，这就是历史上发生过的事情。为什么这次会不同呢？ To understand how things could be different, we might consider the role horses have played in the American economy. As recently as 1915, 25 million horses worked in agriculture and transportation; by 1960, that number had declined to 3 million, and then we stopped keeping track entirely as horses became irrelevant (Kilby, 2007). This decline happened because we figured out how to build tractors, cars and tanks. There were just no uses left for which horses were superior to a mechanical substitute. The economist Wassily Leontief (1952) pointed out that the same thing could happen to humans in his article “Machines and Man”. 为了理解事情会有什么不同，我们可以考虑马匹在美国经济中所扮演的角色。最近在1915年，有2500万匹马在农业和运输业工作；到1960年，这个数字下降到300万，然后我们完全停止了记录，因为马匹变得无关紧要（Kilby，2007）。这种下降的发生是因为我们知道了如何制造拖拉机、汽车和坦克。马匹已经没有比机械替代品更好的用途了。经济学家Wassily Leontief（1952年）在他的文章《机器与人》中指出，同样的事情也可能发生在人类身上。 Humans obviously have a broader range of skills than horses, which is why we have so far always found new employment. So what has changed? Basically, we’ve figured out how to have computers do lots of things that until recently we thought only humans could do, such as driving a car. Digital technology gives us universal computation at zero marginal cost. Suddenly, the idea that we humans might have fewer uses doesn’t seem quite so inconceivable. 显然，人类拥有比马更广泛的技能，这就是为什么我们迄今为止总是能够找到新的就业机会。那么到底发生了什么变化呢？基本上，我们已经找到了让计算机完成许多过去我们认为只有人类能够做的事情的方法，比如开车。数字技术让我们以零边际成本进行普遍计算。突然之间，人类可能有较少用途的想法似乎不再那么难以想象。 Those who claim that this is committing the lump of labor fallacy argue that we haven’t considered a new set of human activities that will employ people, but that line of thinking might also be flawed. Just because we have found new employment in the past doesn’t mean we will in the future. I call this belief the “magic employment fallacy.” 那些声称这是在犯“劳动力总量谬误”的人认为，我们还没有考虑到一套新的人类活动来雇用人，但这种思路可能也是有缺陷的。我们在过去找到了新的就业机会，并不意味着我们在未来也会找到。我把这种信念称为 \"神奇的就业谬论\"。 We can be incredibly creative when it comes to thinking of new things to spend our time on, but the operative question for people selling their labor is whether they can get paid enough to afford solutions to their needs, such as food, shelter and clothing. The only thing that matters for this question is whether a machine or another human is capable of doing whatever we think of more cheaply. 当涉及到思考新的事情来花费我们的时间时，我们可以有令人难以置信的创造力，但对于出售劳动力的人来说，关键的问题是他们是否能得到足够的报酬来负担解决他们的需求，如食物、住所和衣服。对这个问题来说，唯一重要的是机器或另一个人是否有能力更便宜地做我们想到的任何事情。 This turns out to be the central problem with the magic employment fallacy. Nothing in economic theory says what the ‘market-clearing price’ for labor—the wage level at which there is neither unemployment nor a labor shortage—ought to be. It might be well below what people need to cover their needs, which could present a near-term existential threat to many people. We thus appear to face a dilemma. On the one hand, we want to free up human attention for uses that the job loop doesn’t provide for. On the other hand, we want to avoid a rapid collapse of the job loop. In order to understand how we can accomplish both, we need to consider the relationship between the cost of labor and innovation. 这就是神奇就业谬论的核心问题。经济理论中并没有说劳动力的 \"市场清算价格\"--既不存在失业也不存在劳动力短缺的工资水平--应该是什么。它可能远远低于人们满足其需求的水平，这可能对许多人构成近期的生存威胁。因此，我们似乎面临着一个两难境地。一方面，我们想把人的注意力释放出来，用于工作循环所不能提供的用途。另一方面，我们希望避免工作循环的迅速崩溃。为了理解我们如何能够实现这两点，我们需要考虑劳动成本和创新之间的关系。 Expensive Labor and Innovation 昂贵的劳动力和创新 Some people argue that unions made labor expensive, resulting in unaffordable products and services. But in reality, increased labor costs in fact propelled us to become more efficient: entrepreneurs overcame the challenge of more expensive labor by building better machines that required fewer humans. In countries such as India, the abundance of cheap labor meant that for a long time there was little incentive to invest in machines, since it was cheaper to have people do the work by hand. 有些人认为，工会使劳动力变得昂贵，导致产品和服务无法负担。但实际上，劳动力成本的增加实际上推动了我们变得更有效率：企业家们通过制造更好的机器来克服更昂贵的劳动力的挑战，这些机器需要更少的人力。在印度等国家，大量的廉价劳动力意味着在很长一段时间内，没有什么动力去投资机器，因为让人做工作更便宜。 Globally, we face the risk of being stuck in a low innovation trap precisely as a result of a fear that automation will make labor cheap. For example, we might end up with many more years of people driving trucks across the country, long after a machine could do the same job more safely (Wong, 2016). What is the incentive to automate a job if you can get someone to do it for minimum wage? 在全球范围内，我们面临着陷入低创新陷阱的风险，这正是因为担心自动化会使劳动力变得廉价。例如，在机器可以更安全地完成同样的工作之后，我们可能还会有很多年的时间让人们驾驶卡车穿越全国（Wong，2016）。如果你可以用最低工资找人做某项工作，那么有什么动力让工作自动化呢？ Some people object to automation innovations on the grounds that work is an integral part of people’s identity. If you have been a truck driver for many years, for instance, who will you be if you lose your job? At first, this might sound like a completely legitimate question. But it is worth recalling that the idea that purpose primarily has to do with one’s profession, instead of belonging to a religion or to a community, is an Industrial Age phenomenon. 有些人反对自动化创新，理由是工作是人们身份的一个组成部分。例如，如果你已经做了多年的卡车司机，如果你失去了工作，你将成为谁？乍听之下，这可能是一个完全合理的问题。但值得回顾的是，目的主要与一个人的职业有关，而不是属于一个宗教或一个社区，这种想法是工业时代的现象。 If we want to free up attention via automation, we need to come up with new answers to these concerns. That will be the subject of Part Four, but before getting there we will first consider why capitalism by itself can’t solve these problems. 如果我们想通过自动化释放注意力，我们需要对这些问题提出新的答案。这将是第四部分的主题，但在这之前，我们将首先考虑为什么资本主义本身不能解决这些问题。 "},"docs/Part_Three_Attention_Is_Scarce/Limits_of_Capitalism.html":{"url":"docs/Part_Three_Attention_Is_Scarce/Limits_of_Capitalism.html","title":"资本局限","keywords":"","body":"资本局限 Capitalism has been so successful that even theoretically communist countries like China have embraced it. But it cannot solve the scarcity of attention without significant changes in regulation, because of three important limitations. First, prices will always be missing for things that we should be paying attention to. Second, capitalism has limited means for dealing with the concentration in wealth and market power arising from digital technologies. Third, capitalism acts to preserve the interests of capital over knowledge. We need to make changes now, precisely because capitalism has been so successful—the problems that are left are the ones it cannot solve. 资本主义已经非常成功，甚至理论上像中国这样的共产主义国家也接受了它。但是，如果不对监管进行重大改变，它不能解决注意力的稀缺问题，因为有三个重要的限制。首先，对于我们应该关注的东西，价格总是会缺失。第二，资本主义在处理数字技术带来的财富和市场力量的集中方面手段有限。第三，资本主义的行为是为了维护资本对知识的利益。我们现在需要做出改变，正是因为资本主义已经如此成功--剩下的问题是它无法解决的问题。 Missing Prices 遗漏的价格 Capitalism won’t help us allocate attention because it relies on prices that are determined in markets. Prices are powerful because they efficiently aggregate information about consumer preferences and producer capabilities, but not everything can be priced. And increasingly, the things that cannot be priced are becoming more important than those that can: for example, the benefits of space exploration, the cost of the climate crisis, or an individual’s sense of purpose. 资本主义不会帮助我们分配注意力，因为它依赖于市场上决定的价格。价格是强大的，因为它们有效地汇总了关于消费者偏好和生产者能力的信息，但不是所有的东西都能被定价。而且，不能被定价的东西正变得比能被定价的东西更重要：例如，太空探索的好处，气候危机的代价，或个人的使命感。 The lack of prices for many things is not just a question of a missing market that can be created through regulation. The first foundational issue is the zero marginal cost of copies and distribution in the digital realm. From a social perspective, we should make all the world’s knowledge, including services such as medical diagnoses, available for free at the margin. But this means that as long as we rely on the price mechanism, we will under-produce digital resources. Just as the Industrial Age has been full of negative externalities such as pollution, resulting in overproduction, the Knowledge Age is full of positive externalities, such as learning, which implies underproduction. If we rely on the market mechanism, we will not pay nearly enough attention to the creation of free educational resources. 许多东西没有价格，不仅仅是一个可以通过监管创造的市场缺失的问题。第一个基础性问题是数字领域中拷贝和传播的零边际成本。从社会角度来看，我们应该让世界上所有的知识，包括医疗诊断等服务，在边际上免费提供。但这意味着，只要我们依赖价格机制，我们就会对数字资源的生产不足。正如工业时代充满了负面的外部性，如污染，导致生产过剩一样，信息时代充满了正面的外部性，如学习，这意味着生产不足。如果我们依赖市场机制，我们将不会对免费教育资源的创造给予足够的重视。 The second foundational issue is uncertainty. Because prices aggregate information, they fail when no such information exists. When events are either incredibly rare or have never occurred, we have no information on their frequency or severity, and the price mechanism cannot work when forecast error is infinite. For instance, large asteroid impacts on Earth occur millions of years apart, and hence no price can help us allocate attention to detecting them and building systems to deflect them. As a result, we pay a trivial amount of attention to such problems relative to the potential damage they would cause. 第二个基础性问题是不确定性。因为价格是信息的汇总，所以当不存在这种信息时，价格就会失效。当事件非常罕见或从未发生过时，我们没有关于其频率或严重性的信息，当预测误差无限大时，价格机制无法发挥作用。例如，大型小行星对地球的撞击相隔数百万年，因此没有价格可以帮助我们分配注意力来检测它们，并建立系统来抵御它们。因此，相对于它们可能造成的损失，我们对这类问题的关注微不足道。 The third foundational issue is new knowledge. The further removed such knowledge is from creating a product or service that can be sold, the less use the price mechanism is. Consider early aviation pioneers, for example. They pursued flight because they were fascinated by solving a challenge rather than because there was an obvious market for air travel. Or take the early days of quantum computing: actual machines were still decades away, so at that time the price mechanism would not have allocated attention to the discipline. Much of this knowledge therefore needs to be produced by allocating attention through other mechanisms, such as government funded research, academic institutions, and prizes. 第三个基础性问题是新知识。这种知识离创造可以销售的产品或服务越远，价格机制的作用就越小。例如，考虑到早期的航空先驱者。他们追求飞行是因为他们对解决一个挑战感到着迷，而不是因为航空旅行有一个明显的市场。或者以早期的量子计算为例：实际的机器离我们还有几十年的时间，所以在那个时候，价格机制不会把注意力分配给这门学科。因此，大部分知识需要通过其他机制分配注意力来产生，如政府资助的研究、学术机构和奖项。 The fourth foundational issue is that in order for markets and prices to exist, there have to be multiple buyers (demand) and sellers (supply). There is no demand and supply for you to spend time with your children or to figure out your purpose in life. Capitalism cannot help us allocate attention to anything that is deeply personal. 第四个基础问题是，为了使市场和价格得以存在，必须有多个买家（需求）和卖家（供应）。对于你花时间与你的孩子在一起或弄清你的生活目的，没有需求和供应。资本主义不能帮助我们把注意力分配到任何深入个人的事情上。 A way of summarizing all of these examples is to think of the world as divided into an economic sphere (where prices exist) and a non-economic one. Market-based allocation of attention can only succeed in the former and, to the extent that there are insufficient counterweights, will do so at the detriment of attention allocated to the non-economic sphere. This is the high earning parent, who doesn’t spend enough time with their children, or the legions of science PhDs optimizing ad algorithms instead of working on the climate crisis. 总结所有这些例子的方法是，把世界划分为经济领域（存在价格）和非经济领域。基于市场的注意力分配只能在前者成功，而且，如果没有足够的抗衡力量，就会损害分配到非经济领域的注意力。这就是高收入的父母，他们没有花足够的时间与他们的孩子在一起，或者大量的科学博士在优化广告算法，而不是致力于解决气候危机。 Power Laws 权力法则 When it comes to the distribution of income and wealth, many different outcomes are possible, and what actually happens depends both on the underlying production function and government regulation. Consider a manual production function that was common before industrialization. If you were a cobbler making shoes by hand, for instance, there was a limit to the number of shoes you could produce. 当涉及到收入和财富的分配时，许多不同的结果是可能的，而实际发生的情况既取决于基本的生产要素，也取决于政府的监管。考虑一下工业化之前常见的手工生产功能。例如，如果你是一个手工制鞋的鞋匠，你能生产的鞋的数量是有限制的。 Then along came industrialization and economies of scale. If you made more cars, say, you could make them more cheaply. That is why, over time, there were relatively few car manufacturers around the world and the owners of the surviving ones had large fortunes. Still, these manufacturing businesses stayed fairly competitive with each other even as they grew large, which limited their market power and thereby the amount of wealth that they generated. Many service businesses have relatively small economies of scale, which has allowed a great many of them to exist, and markets such as nail salons and restaurants have remained highly competitive. Finance is one clear exception to this among services. A few large banks, insurance companies and brokerage firms tend to dominate the finance industry, and that has accelerated in recent years, largely because financial services have already been heavily impacted by digital technology. 然后，工业化和规模经济随之而来。如果你制造更多的汽车，并且你可以更便宜地制造它们。这就是为什么随着时间的推移，世界各地的汽车制造商相对较少，而幸存的汽车制造商的所有者拥有大量财富。不过，这些制造业企业即使在发展壮大的过程中也保持着相当的竞争性，这限制了他们的市场力量，从而限制了他们所创造的财富数量。许多服务企业的规模经济相对较小，这使得许多企业得以存在，美甲店和餐馆等市场一直保持高度竞争。金融业是服务业中的一个明显例外，少数大型银行、保险公司和经纪公司往往在金融业中占主导地位，而且近年来这种情况在加速发展，主要是因为金融服务已经受到数字技术的严重影响。 With digital technology we are seeing a shift to ever-higher market power and wealth concentration. When you plot the outcomes, such as companies by revenue, the resulting curves look like so-called ‘power laws’: the biggest firm is a lot bigger than the next biggest firm, which in turn is a lot bigger than the third largest, and so on. This pattern is pervasive throughout digital technology and the industries in which it plays a major role. For instance, the most watched video on YouTube has been watched billions of times, while the vast majority of videos have been watched just a few times. In e-commerce, Amazon is an order of magnitude larger than its biggest competitor, and several orders of magnitude larger than most e-commerce companies. The same goes for apps: the leading ones have hundreds of millions of users, but the vast majority have just a few. 随着数字技术的发展，我们看到了市场力量和财富集中度越来越高的转变。当你绘制结果时，例如按收入计算的公司，所产生的曲线看起来像所谓的 \"权力法则\"：最大的公司比下一个最大的公司大得多，而下一个公司又比第三大公司大得多，以此类推。这种模式普遍存在于整个数字技术和它发挥主要作用的行业。例如，YouTube上观看次数最多的视频已经被观看了数十亿次，而绝大多数的视频只被观看了几次。在电子商务领域，亚马逊比其最大的竞争对手大一个数量级，比大多数电子商务公司大几个数量级。应用程序也是如此：领先的应用程序有数以亿计的用户，但绝大多数的应用程序只有几个用户。 Digital technologies are driving these power laws due to zero marginal cost, as explained earlier, as well as through network effects. Network effects occur when a service gets better for all participants as more people or companies join the service. For example, as Facebook grew, both new and early users had more people they could connect with. This means that once a company grows to a certain size it becomes harder and harder for new entrants to compete, as their initially smaller networks offer less benefit to participants. In the absence of some kind of regulation, the combination of zero marginal cost with network effects results in extremely lopsided outcomes. So far, we have seen one social network, Facebook, and one search company, Google, dominate all others. 如前所述，由于零边际成本，以及通过网络效应，数字技术正在推动这些动力法则。当一项服务随着更多的人或公司加入而对所有参与者变得更好时，就会出现网络效应。例如，随着Facebook的发展，新用户和早期用户都有更多的人可以与他们联系。这意味着，一旦一个公司发展到一定规模，新进入者就越来越难以竞争，因为他们最初较小的网络给参与者带来的好处较少。在没有某种监管的情况下，零边际成本与网络效应的结合导致了极其不平衡的结果。到目前为止，我们已经看到一个社交网络Facebook和一个搜索公司Google主导了所有其他网络。 This shift to power laws is driving a huge increase in wealth and income inequality, to levels that are even beyond the previous peak of the early 1900s. Inequality beyond a certain level is socially corrosive, as the wealthy start to live in a world that is disconnected from the problems faced by large parts of the population. 这种权力法则的转变正在推动财富和收入不平等的巨大增长，其水平甚至超过了20世纪初的前一个高峰。超过一定水平的不平等是对社会的腐蚀，因为富人开始生活在一个与大部分人口所面临的问题脱节的世界中。 Beyond the social implications of such inequality, the largest digital companies also wield undue political and market power. When Amazon acquired a relatively small online pharmacy, signaling its intent to compete in that market, there was a dramatic drop in the market capitalization of pharmacy chains. Historically, market power produced inefficient allocations due to excessive rents as prices were kept artificially high. In digital markets, in contrast, powerful companies have often pushed prices down or even made things free. While this appears positive at first, the harm to customers comes via reduced innovation, as companies and investors stop trying to bring better alternative products to market (consider, for example, the lack of innovation in Internet search). 除了这种不平等的社会影响，最大的数字公司还拥有不适当的政治和市场力量。当亚马逊收购了一家相对较小的网上药店，表明其有意在该市场竞争时，连锁药店的市值出现了大幅下降。从历史上看，由于价格被人为地保持在高位，市场力量产生了过度的租金，导致了低效的分配。相反，在数字市场上，强大的公司往往将价格压低，甚至让东西免费。虽然这起初看起来是积极的，但对客户的伤害是通过减少创新来实现的，因为公司和投资者不再尝试将更好的替代产品推向市场（例如，考虑到互联网搜索中缺乏创新）。 Joseph Schumpeter coined the term “creative destruction” to describe the way in which entrepreneurs create new products, technologies, methods, and ultimately economic structures to replace old ones (Kopp, 2021). Indeed, if you look at the dominant companies today, such as Google, Amazon and Facebook, they are all relatively new having displaced in importance those of the Industrial Age. However, such ‘Schumpeterian' innovation will be more difficult going forward, if not downright impossible. During the Industrial Age, machines served a specific purpose, which meant that when a new product or manufacturing technology became available, the installed base of machines became essentially worthless. Today, general-purpose computers can easily implement a new product, add a feature or adopt a new algorithm. Furthermore, production functions with information as a key input have a property known as ‘supermodularity’: the more information you have, the higher the marginal benefit of additional information (Wenger, 2012). This gives the incumbent companies tremendous sustained power—they gain more marginal value from a new product or service than a new entrant does. 约瑟夫-熊彼特创造了 \"创造性破坏 \"一词，以描述企业家创造新产品、新技术、新方法以及最终取代旧的经济结构的方式（Kopp, 2021）。事实上，如果你看看今天占主导地位的公司，如谷歌、亚马逊和Facebook，它们都是相对较新的，在重要性上取代了工业时代的公司。然而，这种 \"熊彼特式 \"的创新在未来将更加困难，如果不是完全不可能的话。在工业时代，机器服务于一个特定的目的，这意味着当一个新的产品或制造技术出现时，机器的安装基础基本上变得毫无价值。今天，通用计算机可以很容易地实现一个新产品，增加一个功能或采用一个新算法。此外，以信息为关键输入的生产要素有一个被称为 \"超模数 \"的属性：你拥有的信息越多，额外信息的边际效益就越高（Wenger，2012）。这给了在位公司巨大的持续能力--他们从一个新产品或服务中获得的边际价值比新进入者要多。 Self-Conservation 自我保护 Toward the end of the Agrarian Age, when land was scarce, political elites came from the landowning classes, and their influence wasn’t truly diminished until after the Second World War. Now, although we have reached the end of the time of capital scarcity, political elites largely represent the interests of capital holders. In some countries, such as China, senior political leaders and their families own large parts of industry outright. In other countries such as the United States, politicians are heavily influenced by the owners of capital because of the need to raise funds, the impact on policy of lobbyists, ’think tanks’ and foundations backed by capital, the skewing of public debate through capital-owned media (e.g. FOX), as well as global ’regulatory competition’ allowing capital owners to play governments off against one another in order to limit wealth redistribution through taxation. Consider just lobbying: over a five-year period, the 200 most politically active companies spent nearly $6 billion to influence policy (Allison & Harkins, 2014). A clever study from 2019 showed how this kind of lobbying directly impacts the language of laws subsequently drafted by lawmakers (O’Dell & Penzenstadler, 2019). 在土地稀缺的农业时代末期，政治精英来自地主阶级，他们的影响力直到第二次世界大战后才真正减弱。现在，虽然我们已经到了资本稀缺时代的尾声，但政治精英们在很大程度上代表了资本持有者的利益。在一些国家，如中国，高级政治领导人和他们的家人直接拥有大量的产业。在其他国家，如美国，政治家受到资本所有者的严重影响，因为需要筹集资金，游说者、\"智囊团 \"和由资本支持的基金会对政策的影响，通过资本拥有的媒体（如FOX）对公共辩论的歪曲，以及全球 \"监管竞争 \"允许资本所有者将政府相互竞争，以便通过税收限制财富再分配。仅考虑游说：在五年期间，政治上最活跃的200家公司花费了近60亿美元来影响政策（Allison & Harkins, 2014）。2019年的一项巧妙研究表明，这种游说如何直接影响立法者随后起草的法律语言（O'Dell & Penzenstadler, 2019）。 The net effect of all of this are policies that are favorable to owners of capital, such as low rates of capital gains tax. Low corporate tax rates, with loopholes that allow corporations to accumulate profits in countries where taxes are low, are also favorable to owners of capital. This is why in many countries we have some of the lowest effective tax rates for corporations and wealthy individuals and families in history (‘effective’ means what is paid after exemptions and other ways of reducing or avoiding tax payments). 所有这些的净效果都是有利于资本所有者的政策，如低资本收益税率。低的公司税率，以及允许公司在低税率国家积累利润的漏洞，也对资本所有者有利。这就是为什么在许多国家，我们有一些历史上最低的公司和富有的个人和家庭的有效税率（\"有效 \"是指在豁免和其他减少或避免纳税的方式之后所支付的税款）。 In addition to preserving and creating financial benefits for the owners of capital, corporations have also attacked the creation and sharing of knowledge. They have lobbied heavily to lengthen terms of copyright and to strengthen copyright protection. And scientific publishers have made access to knowledge so expensive that libraries and universities struggle to afford the subscriptions (Sample, 2018; Buranyi, 2018). 除了为资本所有者保留和创造经济利益外，公司还攻击了知识的创造和分享。他们为延长版权期限和加强版权保护进行了大量的游说。而科学出版商让知识的获取变得如此昂贵，以至于图书馆和大学都难以负担订阅费用（Sample，2018；Buranyi，2018）。 A key limitation of capitalism thus is that without meaningful change, it will keep us trapped in the Industrial Age by keeping governments and the political process focused on capital. As long as that is the case, we will continue to over-allocate attention to work and consumption, and under-allocate it to areas such as the individual need for meaning and the collective need for the growth of knowledge. Parts Four and Five of The World After Capital will examine how we can get out of the Industrial Age, but first we will take a closer look at the power of knowledge and the promise of the digital knowledge loop. 因此，资本主义的一个关键限制是，如果没有有意义的改变，它将使我们困在工业时代，使政府和政治进程聚焦于资本。只要这种情况存在，我们就会继续过度关注工作和消费，而对个人对意义的需求和集体对知识增长的需求等领域的关注不足。《资本后的世界》第四和第五部分将探讨我们如何才能走出工业时代，但首先我们将仔细研究知识的力量和数字知识圈的承诺。 "},"docs/Part_Three_Attention_Is_Scarce/Power_of_Knowledge.html":{"url":"docs/Part_Three_Attention_Is_Scarce/Power_of_Knowledge.html","title":"知识力量","keywords":"","body":"知识力量 Have you watched television recently? Stored food in a refrigerator? Accessed the Internet? Played games on your smartphone? Driven a car? These are all things that billions of people around the world do every day. And while they are produced by different companies using a wide range of technologies, none of them would be possible without the existence of knowledge. 你最近看了电视吗？在冰箱里储存食物？上过互联网吗？在你的智能手机上玩游戏？驾驶汽车？这些都是全世界数十亿人每天都在做的事情。虽然它们是由不同的公司使用广泛的技术生产的，但如果没有知识的存在，这些都是不可能的。 Knowledge, as I have earlier defined it, is the information that humanity has recorded in a medium and improved over time. As a reminder, there are two crucial parts to this definition. The first is “recorded in a medium,” which allows information to be shared across time and space. The second is “improved over time,” which separates knowledge from information. Improvement is the result of the operation of the critical process, which allows for existing knowledge to be criticized and alternatives to be proposed. Through this process knowledge becomes better at helping us humans meet our needs. 正如我前面所定义的那样，知识是人类用一种媒介记录下来并随着时间的推移而改进的信息。作为提醒，这个定义有两个关键部分。第一部分是 \"记录在媒介中\"，这使得信息可以跨越时间和空间共享。第二个部分是 \"随着时间的推移而改进\"，它将知识与信息分开。改进是关键过程运作的结果，它允许对现有知识进行批评并提出替代方案。通过这个过程，知识在帮助我们人类满足需求方面变得更好。 I began this section with examples of everyday technologies that would not exist without knowledge. An even stronger illustration of the power of knowledge is that without it, many of us would not even be here today. As we saw in our discussion of population, Malthus was right about population growth but wrong about its consequences because he did not foresee the development of technological progress powered by improved knowledge. 我在本节开始时举了一些日常技术的例子，如果没有知识就不会存在。对知识力量的一个更有力的说明是，没有知识，我们中的许多人甚至不会有今天。正如我们在讨论人口问题时看到的那样，马尔萨斯对人口增长的看法是正确的，但对其后果的看法是错误的，因为他没有预见到由改进的知识推动的技术进步的发展。 Let’s look at a specific example of how this process unfolded. Humans breathe air, but for a long time we did not know what it consisted of. Oxygen and nitrogen, the two primary components of air, were not identified as elements until the late eighteenth century. 让我们看一下这个过程是如何展开的一个具体例子。人类呼吸空气，但在很长一段时间里，我们不知道空气是由什么组成的。氧气和氮气，空气的两个主要成分，直到18世纪末才被确定为元素。 Separately, although manure had been used in agricultural practice for millennia, it was not properly studied until the early nineteenth century. By the late 19th century, scientists had finally discovered the microbes that convert nitrogen into a form that plants can use. That led to the understanding that ammonia, which consists of nitrogen and hydrogen, is a powerful fertilizer. Scientific progress eventually resulted in the Haber process for nitrogen fixation which allows for the mass production of fertilizer. Invented in the early twentieth century, it became crucial to raising agricultural yields globally, thus averting the dire consequences Malthus had envisaged. Today, about half of the nitrogen in humans bodies has been touched by the Haber process on its way into the plants and animals that we eat . 另外，尽管粪便在农业实践中已经使用了几千年，但直到19世纪初才对它进行了适当的研究。到19世纪末，科学家们终于发现了将氮转化为植物可以使用的形式的微生物。这使人们认识到，由氮和氢组成的氨是一种强大的肥料。科学的进步最终导致了哈伯固氮过程，这使得肥料的大规模生产成为可能。二十世纪初发明的这一工艺对提高全球农业产量至关重要，从而避免了马尔萨斯设想的可怕后果。今天，人类体内约有一半的氮在进入我们所吃的植物和动物的过程中被哈伯过程所触及。 My simplified history of the discovery of nitrogen fixation doesn’t capture the many false starts along the way. It seems strange to us now, but at one point a leading theory as to why some materials burn was that they all contain a substance called ‘phlogiston,’ which was thought to be released during combustion or ‘dephlogistication.’ Without the improvement of knowledge over time, we might have remained stuck on that theory, failing to find oxygen and nitrogen and thus to increase agricultural yields, and thereby potentially exposing humanity to a Malthusian crisis. 我对发现固氮作用的简化历史并没有捕捉到沿途的许多错误开始。在我们现在看来很奇怪，但在某一时期，关于一些材料燃烧的主要理论是它们都含有一种叫做'phlogiston'的物质，人们认为它是在燃烧或'dephlogistication'过程中释放的。如果没有随着时间推移知识的改进，我们可能一直停留在这个理论上，无法找到氧气和氮气，从而无法提高农业产量，从而有可能使人类面临马尔萨斯危机。 This is just one example of a knowledge breakthrough that allowed humanity to overcome a seemingly insurmountable barrier to progress. When thinking about the power of knowledge, we must remember that both our individual lifetimes and the history of modern science to-date are trivially short in the timescale of humanity, which in turn is minuscule compared to that of the universe. When considering longer timeframes, we should regard all speculative technological advances that don’t contravene the laws of physics as possible and eventually achievable. This line of thinking about the power of knowledge is inspired by a theoretical foundation for science recently developed by the physicists David Deutsch and Chiara Marletto called constructor theory (“Constructor Theory,” 2020). 这只是知识突破的一个例子，它使人类克服了一个看似不可逾越的进步障碍。在思考知识的力量时，我们必须记住，无论是我们个人的一生还是迄今为止的现代科学史，在人类的时间尺度上都是微不足道的，而人类的时间尺度与宇宙的时间尺度相比又是微不足道的。当考虑更长的时间框架时，我们应该把所有不违反物理定律的推测性技术进步视为可能的，并最终可以实现。这种关于知识力量的思路受到物理学家大卫-多伊奇和基娅拉-马莱托最近提出的科学理论基础的启发，该理论被称为构造者理论（\"构造者理论\"，2020）。 Consider for a moment what knowledge might allow us to do in the more or less distant future. We might rid ourselves of our dependence on fossil fuels, cure any disease, and travel to other planets in our solar system (organizations like SpaceX and NASA are already working toward this goal) (NASA, 2018). Eventually, we might even travel to the stars. You might think interstellar travel is impossible, but it isn’t. Extremely difficult? Yes. Requiring technology that doesn’t exist yet? Yes. But impossible? No. It is definitely not imminent, but we can count on it to becoming possible with the further accretion of knowledge. 请稍微考虑一下，在不远的将来，知识可能让我们能够做些什么。我们可能会摆脱对化石燃料的依赖，治愈任何疾病，并在我们的太阳系中去其他行星旅行（像SpaceX和NASA这样的组织已经在朝这个目标努力）（NASA，2018）。最终，我们甚至可能会去星际旅行。你可能认为星际旅行是不可能的，但实际上并非如此。非常困难吗？是的。需要尚不存在的技术吗？是的。但是不可能吗？不。虽然这并不即将发生，但随着知识的进一步积累，我们可以指望它成为可能。 We are the only species on Earth that has created knowledge—not just science, but also art. Art allows us to express our hopes and fears, and culture has helped to motivate the large-scale coordination and mobilization of human effort. We might think of the technical component of knowledge as underpinning the ‘how’ of our lives, and the artistic component the ‘why’. If you’ve ever doubted the power of art, just think of the many times throughout history when dictators and authoritarian regimes have banned or destroyed works of art. 我们是地球上唯一创造了知识的物种--不仅仅是科学，还有艺术。艺术使我们能够表达我们的希望和恐惧，而文化则有助于激励人类的大规模协调和动员。我们可以认为，知识的技术部分支撑着我们生活的 \"如何\"，而艺术部分则支撑着 \"为什么\"。如果你曾经怀疑过艺术的力量，只要想想历史上许多次独裁者和专制政权禁止或摧毁艺术作品的情况。 The Knowledge Loop 知识循环 Knowledge has already made possible something extraordinary: by means of the innovations of the Industrial Age we can, in principle, meet everyone’s needs. But we must generate additional knowledge to solve the problems we have introduced along the way, such as the climate crisis. New knowledge does not spring forth fully formed out of a vacuum. Instead it emerges through what I call the ‘knowledge loop’, in which someone learns something and creates something new, which is then shared and in turn serves as the basis for more learning. 知识已经使一些非凡的事情成为可能：通过工业时代的创新，我们原则上可以满足每个人的需求。但我们必须产生更多的知识来解决我们一路走来所带来的问题，如气候危机。新的知识不会凭空产生。相反，它是通过我所说的 \"知识循环 \"出现的，在这个循环中，有人学习了一些东西，创造了一些新的东西，然后被分享，反过来成为更多学习的基础。 ​​ The Knowledge Loop The knowledge loop has been around since humans first developed written language, some five thousand years ago. Before that, humans were able to use spoken language, but that limits learning and sharing in terms of both time and space. Since the invention of written language, breakthroughs have accelerated and access to the knowledge loop has broadened. Those include moveable type (around one thousand years ago), the printing press (around five hundred years ago) and more recently the telegraph, radio and television. Now we are in the middle of another fundamental breakthrough: digital technology, which connects all of humanity to the knowledge loop at zero marginal cost, and also allows machines themselves to participate in it. 自从人类在大约五千年前首次开发出书面语言以来，知识循环就一直存在。在此之前，人类能够使用口语，但这在时间和空间上都限制了学习和分享。自从发明书面语言以来，突破性的进展加快了，进入知识圈的途径也扩大了。这些包括可移动的字体（大约一千年前），印刷术（大约五百年前）以及最近的电报、广播和电视。现在，我们正处于另一个根本性的突破之中：数字技术，它以零边际成本将全人类与知识圈连接起来，同时也允许机器本身参与其中。 It is easy to underestimate the potential of digital technology to further accelerate and broaden access to the knowledge loop. To many people, it seems as if these innovations have so far under-delivered. The technology investor Peter Thiel once famously complained that “We wanted flying cars, instead we got 140 characters.” In fact, we have made great progress on flying cars since then, in no small part because digital technologies have already helped accelerate the knowledge loop. 我们很容易低估数字技术在进一步加速和拓宽知识圈方面的潜力。对许多人来说，这些创新似乎到目前为止还没有达到预期效果。技术投资者彼得-泰尔曾有一句著名的抱怨：\"我们想要的是飞行汽车，而我们得到的是140个字符\"。事实上，从那时起，我们在飞行汽车方面已经取得了巨大的进展，这在很大程度上是因为数字技术已经帮助加速了知识循环。 The Promise and Peril of the Digital Knowledge Loop 数字知识圈的承诺和危险 The zero marginal cost and universality of digital technologies are already accelerating learning, creating and sharing, giving rise to a digital knowledge loop. And as can be seen in the example of YouTube, it holds both amazing promise and great peril. 数字技术的零边际成本和普遍性已经加速了学习、创造和分享，产生了一个数字知识循环。从YouTube的例子中可以看出，它既拥有惊人的前景，也存在巨大的危险。 YouTube has experienced astounding growth since its launch in 2005. People around the world now upload over 100 hours of video content to the platform every minute. To illustrate just how much content that is, if you were to spend 100 years watching YouTube 24 hours a day, you would be unable to watch all the videos uploaded in a single week. YouTube contains amazing educational content on topics as diverse as gardening and pure mathematics. Many of those videos illustrate the promise of the digital knowledge loop, but the peril is also clear: YouTube also contains videos that peddle conspiracies, spread misinformation and even incite hate. Promoting such videos may, perversely, be in YouTube’s interest, as these capture more attention, which can then be resold to advertisers, thus growing YouTube’s revenues and profits. 自2005年推出以来，YouTube经历了令人震惊的增长。现在，世界各地的人们每分钟向该平台上传100多个小时的视频内容。为了说明这有多少内容，如果你花100年时间每天24小时观看YouTube，你将无法看完一个星期内上传的所有视频。YouTube包含了惊人的教育内容，主题包括园艺和纯数学等。其中许多视频说明了数字知识圈的前景，但危险也很明显：YouTube也包含兜售阴谋、传播错误信息、甚至煽动仇恨的视频。推广这类视频可能反倒符合YouTube的利益，因为这些视频能吸引更多的注意力，然后可以转卖给广告商，从而增加YouTube的收入和利润。 Both the promise and the peril are made possible by the same characteristics of the platform: all of the videos are available for free to anyone in the world, and they become available globally the second they are published. Anybody can publish a video, and all you need to access them is an Internet connection and a smartphone. As a result, two to three billion people, almost half of the world’s population, has access to YouTube and can participate in the digital knowledge loop. 承诺和危险都是由该平台的相同特点促成的：所有的视频对世界上的任何人都是免费的，而且在发布的一瞬间就可以在全球范围内获得。任何人都可以发布视频，你只需要一个互联网连接和一部智能手机就可以访问它们。因此，20至30亿人，几乎占世界人口的一半，可以访问YouTube，并可以参与数字知识圈。 These characteristics are found in other systems that similarly show the promise and peril of the digital knowledge loop. Wikipedia, the collectively produced online encyclopedia, is another good example. At its most promising, someone might read an entry and learn the method Pythagoras used to approximate pi, then create an animation that illustrates this method, publishing it on Wikipedia, thus making it easier for other people to learn. Wikipedia entries result from collaboration and an ongoing revision process. You can also examine both the history of the page and the conversations about it, thanks to a piece of software known as a ‘wiki’ that keeps track of the history of edits to a page (“Wiki,” n.d.). When the process works, it raises the quality of entries over time. But when there is a coordinated effort at manipulation, Wikipedia can spread misinformation instantly and globally. 这些特征在其他系统中也可以找到，这些系统同样显示了数字知识循环的前景和危险性。维基百科，这个集体制作的在线百科全书，是另一个好例子。在它最有希望的时候，有人可能会阅读一个条目并学习毕达哥拉斯用来近似圆周率的方法，然后创建一个动画来说明这个方法，并将其发布在维基百科上，从而使其他人更容易学习。维基百科的条目来自于合作和持续的修订过程。你还可以检查页面的历史和关于它的对话，这要归功于一个被称为 \"维基 \"的软件，它可以跟踪页面的编辑历史（\"维基\"，n.d.）。当这个过程有效时，它可以随着时间的推移提高条目的质量。但是，当有一个协调的操纵努力时，维基百科可以立即在全球传播错误信息。 Wikipedia illustrates another important aspect of the digital knowledge loop: it allows individuals to participate in extremely small ways. If you wish, you can contribute to Wikipedia by fixing a single typo. If ten thousand people fixed one typo every day, that would be 3.65 million typos a year. If we assume that it takes two minutes to discover and fix a typo, it would take nearly fifty people working full-time for a year (2,500 hours) to fix that many typos. 维基百科说明了数字知识圈的另一个重要方面：它允许个人以极小的方式参与。如果你愿意，你可以通过修正一个错别字来为维基百科做出贡献。如果每天有一万个人修正一个错别字，那么一年就有365万个错别字。如果我们假设发现和纠正一个错别字需要两分钟，那么需要将近50个人全职工作一年（2500小时）才能纠正这么多错别字。 The example of a Wikipedia spelling correction shows the power of small contributions that add up within the digital knowledge loop. Their peril can be seen on social networks such as Twitter and Facebook, where the small contributions are likes and retweets or reposts to one’s friends or followers. While these tiny actions can amplify high-quality content, they can also spread mistakes, rumors and propaganda: indeed, research carried out at MIT in 2018 found that fake news stories spread faster and more widely than true ones (Vosoughi et al., 2018) (see “Freedom to Learn”, below). These information cascades can have significant consequences, ranging from jokes going viral to the outcomes of elections being affected. They have even contributed to major outbreaks of violence, as in the well-known case of the brutal persecution of the Rohingya in Myanmar (BBC News, 2018). 维基百科的拼写更正的例子显示了在数字知识圈中小贡献的力量。在Twitter和Facebook等社交网络上可以看到它们的危险，在那里，小贡献是喜欢和转发或转贴给自己的朋友或追随者。虽然这些微小的行动可以放大高质量的内容，但它们也可以传播错误、谣言和宣传：事实上，2018年在麻省理工学院进行的研究发现，假新闻故事比真新闻传播得更快、更广（Vosoughi等人，2018）（见下文 \"学习自由\"）。这些信息级联可以产生重大的后果，从笑话的病毒式传播到选举结果受到影响。它们甚至促成了重大暴力事件的爆发，比如众所周知的缅甸罗兴亚人遭受残酷迫害的案例（BBC新闻，2018）。 Some platforms make it possible for people to contribute passively to the digital knowledge loop. Waze is a GPS navigation app. It tracks users that seem to be in a car, and the speed at which they are moving. It then passes that information back to its servers, and algorithms figure out where traffic is moving smoothly and where drivers will encounter traffic jams. Waze then proposes alternative routes, taking the traffic into account. If you follow a different route proposed by Waze, you automatically contribute your speed on that detour, a further example of passive contribution. 一些平台使人们有可能被动地对数字知识循环作出贡献。Waze是一个GPS导航应用程序。它追踪那些似乎在车里的用户，以及他们的移动速度。然后它把这些信息传回服务器，通过算法计算出哪里交通顺畅，哪里的司机会遇到交通拥堵。然后，Waze在考虑到交通情况的基础上，提出替代路线。如果你遵循Waze提出的不同路线，你会自动贡献出你在这条弯路上的速度，这是一个被动贡献的进一步例子。 To see the peril of passive contribution, consider Google’s autocomplete for search queries, which are derived from what people frequently search for. As a result, they often reflect existing biases, further amplifying them: often, instead of typing out their whole query, users select one of the autocompleted options presented to them. Another example of dangerous passive contribution are suggested ’follows’ on networks such as Twitter. These often present accounts of people similar to the ones someone is already connected with, thus deepening connections among people who think alike while cutting them off from other groups, a phenomenon giving rise to a kind of “Cyber-Balkans” (Van Alstyne & Brynjolfsson, 2005). 要看到被动贡献的危险性，请考虑谷歌的搜索查询自动完成功能，它来自人们经常搜索的内容。因此，它们往往反映了现有的偏见，并进一步放大了这些偏见：用户往往不输入他们的整个查询，而是选择呈现给他们的自动完成的选项中的一个。另一个危险的被动贡献的例子是Twitter等网络上的建议 \"关注\"。这些人的账户往往与某人已经连接的人相似，从而加深了想法相同的人之间的联系，同时也切断了他们与其他群体的联系，这种现象产生了一种 \"网络巴尔干\"（Van Alstyne & Brynjolfsson, 2005）。 The promise of the digital knowledge loop is broad access to a rapidly improving body of knowledge. The peril is that it will lead to a post-truth society that is constantly in conflict. Both of these possibilities are enabled by the same characteristics of digital technologies. Here once again, we can see that technology by itself does not determine the future. 数字知识圈的承诺是广泛获取快速改进的知识体系。其危险性在于它将导致一个不断冲突的后真相社会。这两种可能性都是由数字技术的相同特征促成的。在这里，我们可以再次看到，技术本身并不能决定未来。 Technology Is Not Enough 技术是不够的 To achieve the promise of the digital knowledge loop and sidestep its perils will require human societies to go through a massive transition, on a par with the two previous ones, from the Forager Age to the Agrarian Age and from the Agrarian Age to the Industrial Age. We now need to leave the Industrial Age behind and enter the next one, which I am calling the Knowledge Age. We have based our economies around the job loop, which traps a lot of our attention. We have constructed our laws governing access to information and computation as if they were industrial products. We have adopted a range of beliefs that keep us tied to jobs and consumption, and we are utterly overwhelmed by the new information environment. All of that has to change. 为了实现数字知识圈的承诺并避开其危险，人类社会需要经历一次大规模的转型，与之前的两次转型一样，从采集狩猎时代到农业时代，从农业时代到工业时代。我们现在需要抛弃工业时代，进入下一个时代，我称之为知识时代。我们的经济是围绕着工作循环的，这吸引了我们很多的注意力。我们构建了管理信息和计算的法律，仿佛它们是工业产品。我们采用了一系列的信念，将我们与工作和消费联系在一起，而我们完全被新的信息环境所淹没了，所有这些都必须要改变。 The transition will be difficult, however, because the Industrial Age is a system with many interlocking parts, and systems are highly resistant to change. As we saw earlier, simply harnessing digital technology to the existing system results in a hugely uneven distribution of power, income and wealth. Even worse, it tilts the digital knowledge loop away from its promise and toward its perils. 然而，转型将是困难的，因为工业时代是一个有许多相互关联的部分系统，而系统是非常抗拒变化的。正如我们前面所看到的，简单地将数字技术用于现有系统，会导致权力、收入和财富的巨大不平衡。更糟糕的是，它使数字知识圈偏离了它的承诺，走向了它的危险。 The human species is facing problems that we can only overcome if we use digital technology to alleviate rather than worsen attention scarcity. We must reap the promise and limit the perils of digital technology for the knowledge loop. In order to successfully negotiate the transition into the Knowledge Age, we need to make dramatic changes in both collective regulation and self-regulation. This is what we will explore in Part Four. 人类面临的问题，只有当我们利用数字技术来缓解而不是加剧注意力的匮乏时，我们才能克服。我们必须收获数字技术对知识圈的承诺并限制其危险。为了成功地协商过渡到知识时代，我们需要在集体监管和自我监管方面做出巨大的改变。这就是我们将在第四部分探讨的内容。 "},"docs/Part_Four_Enhancing_Freedom.html":{"url":"docs/Part_Four_Enhancing_Freedom.html","title":"第四部分：加强自由","keywords":"","body":"第四部分：加强自由 My first major aim in writing this book was to establish that we are currently experiencing a period of non-linear change, and my second aim is to outline a plan for our transition to the Knowledge Age. Our challenge is to overcome the limits of capitalism and move away from a society centered on the job loop toward one that embraces the knowledge loop. This section of The World After Capital will propose changes in regulation and self-regulation that would increase human freedom and unlock the promise of the digital knowledge loop. There are three components to this: 我写这本书的首要目标是要确定我们目前正处于一个非线性变革时期，而我的第二个目标是为我们向知识时代的过渡规划提出框架。我们的挑战是要克服资本主义的局限，从以工作循环为中心的社会转向拥抱知识循环的社会。《资本后的世界》的这一部分将提出一些改变监管和自我监管的措施，以增加人类的自由，并释放数字知识循环的潜力。其中包括以下三个方面： 1.Economic freedom. We must ensure that everyone’s needs are met without them being forced into the job loop. Once we have economic freedom, we can embrace automation and enable everyone to participate in and benefit from the digital knowledge loop. 2.Informational freedom. We must remove barriers to the digital knowledge loop that limit our ability to learn from existing knowledge, in order to accelerate the creation and sharing of new knowledge. At the same time, we must build systems into the digital knowledge loop that support critical inquiry. 3.Psychological freedom. We must free ourselves from scarcity thinking and the associated fears that impede our participation in the digital knowledge loop. Learning, creating and sharing knowledge all require us to overcome barriers in our minds, some of which are evolutionary and others the result of social pressure. 经济自由。我们必须确保每个人的需求得到满足，而不是被迫进入工作循环。一旦我们拥有经济自由，我们就可以拥抱自动化，并让每个人参与和从数字知识循环中获益。 信息自由。我们必须消除限制我们从现有知识中学习的数字知识循环的障碍，以加速新知识的创造和分享。同时，我们必须在数字知识循环中构建支持批判性探究的系统。 心灵自由。我们必须从贫乏思维和相关的恐惧中解放自己，这些恐惧会妨碍我们参与数字知识循环。学习、创造和分享知识都需要我们克服心理上的障碍，其中一些是进化的结果，而另一些则是社会压力造成的。 With these increased freedoms will come the possibility of a peaceful transition from the Industrial Age to the Knowledge Age that is not dictated from the top down, but results from the choices of individuals and the communities they form. There is no guarantee that these changes will be sufficient to avoid a disastrous transition, but I am convinced that without them we are headed for just that, incurring species-level risk for humanity. Later in the book I will discuss the values and systems that are necessary for successful collective action in a world of increased individual freedom. 随着这些自由的增加，我们将有可能实现从工业时代到知识时代的和平过渡，而这种过渡不是自上而下的，而是源自个人和他们形成的社群所做出的选择。虽然这些变化并不能保证避免灾难性的转变，但我确信如果没有这些变化，我们就会步入那个境地，从而为人类带来物种灭绝的风险。在本书的后面，我将讨论在个人自由增加的世界中，成功的集体行动所必需的价值观和体系。 "},"docs/Part_Four_Enhancing_Freedom/Economic_Freedom.html":{"url":"docs/Part_Four_Enhancing_Freedom/Economic_Freedom.html","title":"经济自由","keywords":"","body":"经济自由 If you were to quit your job right now, could you afford to take care of your needs? And if you are retired, what would happen if you suddenly stopped receiving your pension? If you are supported by a spouse or partner, could you still afford food, shelter and clothing without them? If you could no longer meet your needs in any of these situations, you are not economically free. Your decisions on how much of your labor to sell and whom to sell it to, whether to stay with your partner and where to live, are not free decisions. 如果你现在辞去工作，你是否能负担得起你的需求？如果你已经退休了，如果你突然停止领取养老金，会发生什么？如果你有配偶或伴侣支持，没有他们，你还能负担得起食物、住所和衣服吗？如果你在上述任何一种情况下都无法再满足你的需求，那么你在经济上就不自由。你决定出售多少劳动，卖给谁，是否与你的伴侣在一起，住在哪里，都不是自由决定。 Many people in the US are not free in this sense. A recent survey asked respondents if they had enough money to pay for a $1,000 emergency, and 60 percent said they did not (Leonhardt, 2020). Other studies have found that about 75 percent of Americans over the age of forty are behind on saving for retirement, and somewhere between a quarter and a third of all non-retired adults have no savings at all (Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, 2020; Backman, 2020). This data predates the COVID-19 pandemic which wreaked further havoc on the finances of many Americans. 在美国，许多人在这个意义上是不自由的。最近的一项调查问受访者他们是否有足够的钱来支付1000美元的紧急情况，60%的人说他们没有（Leonhardt, 2020）。其他研究发现，大约75%的40岁以上的美国人没有为退休储蓄，大约四分之一到三分之一的非退休成年人根本没有储蓄（联邦储备系统理事会，2020；Backman，2020）。这一数据早于19年的COVID大流行，它对许多美国人的财务状况造成了进一步的破坏。 If you are not economically free, you are not able to participate freely in the knowledge loop, which is why economic freedom is a cornerstone of the Knowledge Age. We must make people economically free so that they have the time to learn new knowledge, from practical skills to the latest theoretical physics. We need them to create new knowledge using what they have learned. And finally, we need them to share this knowledge with others. 如果你在经济上不自由，你就不能自由地参与知识圈，这就是为什么经济自由是信息时代的一个基石。我们必须让人们在经济上自由，这样他们才有时间学习新知识，从实用技能到最新的理论物理学。我们需要他们利用他们所学的知识创造新的知识。最后，我们需要他们与他人分享这些知识。 Participation in the knowledge loop has never been more important: we have massive problems to overcome, including the COVID-19 pandemic and, above all, the climate crisis. To do so, we must be able to embrace automation rather than feel threatened by it. 参与知识循环从未如此重要：我们有大量的问题需要克服，包括COVID-19大流行病，首先是气候危机。要做到这一点，我们必须能够拥抱自动化，而不是感到受其威胁。 Universal Basic Income 全民基本收入 Economic freedom is a reality for the wealthy, for tenured professors and retirees with pensions and savings, but how can we make it a reality for everyone? The answer is to provide everyone with a guaranteed income to cover solutions to their needs, including housing, clothing and food. This income wouldn’t depend on whether someone is married or single, employed or unemployed, rich or poor—it would be unconditional (also referred to as ‘universal’). 经济自由对于富人、终身教授和拥有退休金和储蓄的退休人员来说是一个现实，但我们如何才能使它成为每个人的现实？答案是为每个人提供有保障的收入，以支付解决他们的需求，包括住房、衣服和食物。这种收入将不取决于某人是已婚还是单身，是就业还是失业，是富有还是贫穷--它将是无条件的（也被称为 \"普遍\"）。 At first glance, this idea of a ‘universal basic income’ (UBI) may seem outrageous. Getting paid simply for being alive—isn’t that akin to socialism? Where would this money come from? And won’t people simply descend into laziness and drug addiction? We will examine each of these objections to UBI in turn, but let’s first consider the arguments for UBI as a way of achieving economic freedom. 乍一看，\"全民基本收入\"（UBI）的想法可能看起来很离谱。仅仅因为活着就能得到报酬，这不是类似于社会主义吗？这些钱从哪里来？人们不就会陷入懒惰和吸毒的境地吗？我们将依次研究这些对UBI的反对意见，但首先让我们考虑UBI作为实现经济自由的一种方式的论点。 Concerns about economic freedom are by no means new. When the American republic was in its infancy, economic freedom was within the reach of those involved in the colonial project. There was plenty of land available to settler colonialists, and they could hypothetically make ends meet through small-scale farming (also known as subsistence farming). Thomas Jefferson considered formalizing the idea of land grants as a way of ensuring a free citizenry. It is important to point out that this land was being taken away from Native Americans, who were losing both their land and their freedom, on the basis of the so-called Doctrine of Discovery (“Discovery Doctrine,” 2020). Even back then, observers such as the philosopher and political activist Thomas Paine (1797) understood that land that could be appropriated and allocated to settlers as property would run out at some point, raising the specter of a time when landless citizens might have to rent themselves out as laborers in order to provide for their needs, leading him to conclude that an alternative to land would be to give people money instead. The idea of increased freedom through direct cash transfers thus dates back to the earliest days of the American republic. 对经济自由的关注绝非新鲜事。当美国共和国处于起步阶段时，经济自由对那些参与殖民计划的人来说是可以实现的。定居的殖民者有大量的土地，他们可以通过小规模的耕作（也称为自给自足的耕作）来满足假设的需求。托马斯-杰斐逊考虑将土地授予的想法正式化，作为确保自由公民的一种方式。需要指出的是，这些土地是从美洲原住民手中夺走的，他们既失去了土地，也失去了自由，其依据是所谓的 \"发现论\"（\"发现论\"，2020年）。即使在那时，哲学家和政治活动家托马斯-潘恩（Thomas Paine，1797年）等观察家也明白，可以作为财产被征用并分配给定居者的土地会在某一时刻耗尽，这让人担心，为了满足他们的需求，没有土地的公民可能不得不把自己租出去当劳工，这让他得出结论，替代土地的办法是给人们钱。因此，通过直接的现金转移来增加自由的想法可以追溯到美国共和国的最早时期。 If you don’t find this argument for UBI compelling, consider the case of air. We can all afford to breathe air because it is free and distributed around the globe (important side note: regulation is required to keep it clean—there were many problems with air pollution during industrialization, and it is estimated that more than seven million people still die around the world every year from air pollution) (World Health Organization, n.d.). Our freedom is thus not restricted by having to find air, and the power of UBI would be to make us equally free when it comes to our other needs, by making food, housing and clothing affordable for everyone. 如果你不觉得UBI的这个论点有说服力，可以考虑一下空气的情况。我们都能呼吸得起空气，因为它是免费的，而且分布在全球各地（重要的题外话：需要监管来保持空气的清洁--在工业化时期有很多空气污染的问题，据估计，全世界每年仍有超过700万人死于空气污染）（世界卫生组织，n.d.）。因此，我们的自由并没有因为必须寻找空气而受到限制，UBI的力量将是通过使每个人都能负担得起食物、住房和衣服，使我们在涉及其他需求时同样自由。 As I argued earlier, our technologies are sufficiently advanced that we are capable of meeting everyone’s needs. Farming can generate enough food for everyone. We can easily make enough clothing and provide everyone with shelter. It is the knowledge and capital that humanity has created that have made this possible. And our technological progress is accelerating while global population growth is slowing, so all this will get easier—that is, as long as we generate enough new knowledge to overcome the problems we are facing, starting with the climate crisis. 正如我之前所说，我们的技术已经足够先进，能够满足所有人的需求。耕种可以为每个人产生足够的食物。我们可以很容易地制造足够的衣服，为每个人提供住所。正是人类所创造的知识和资本使之成为可能。而且我们的技术进步正在加速，而全球人口增长正在放缓，所以所有这些都会变得更容易--也就是说，只要我们产生足够的新知识来克服我们所面临的问题，首先是气候危机。 The question is not whether we have the ability to meet everyone’s needs, but whether our economy and society distribute the resources fairly, and that is where UBI comes in. A UBI enables markets to function without forcing people into the job loop. It lets everyone freely choose whether and how much to participate in these markets and how much to devote to personal relationships, the pursuit of meaning, curiosity and creativity, etc.—freeing up attention and enabling people to form new communities in more affordable geographies (e.g. smaller cities or the countryside). 问题不是我们是否有能力满足每个人的需求，而是我们的经济和社会是否公平地分配资源，而这正是UBI的作用。UBI使市场能够运作，而不强迫人们进入工作圈。它让每个人都能自由选择是否参与这些市场，以及参与多少，并将多少投入到个人关系、对意义的追求、好奇心和创造力等方面--释放注意力，使人们能够在更可负担的地域（如小城市或乡村）形成新的社区。 Industrial society presents us with two different ways of allocating resources. In one, individuals participate in a market economy; in the other, governments provide for people’s needs. Those options form the extremes of a spectrum that has a variety of ‘hybrid’ arrangements in the middle, such as government-subsidized housing, for which people pay reduced rent. UBI broadens the scope for market-based allocation, thus reducing reliance on an ever-expanding government sector. In that regard it is the opposite of socialism and communism, which rely predominantly or even entirely on government allocation. 工业社会为我们提供了两种不同的资源分配方式。一种是个人参与市场经济；另一种是政府满足人们的需求。这些选择构成了一个光谱的两端，在中间有各种 \"混合 \"安排，如政府补贴的住房，人们支付的租金减少。UBI扩大了基于市场的分配范围，从而减少对不断扩大的政府部门的依赖。在这方面，它与社会主义和共产主义相反，后者主要甚至完全依赖政府分配。 Right after the Second World War, only about 5 percent of people in the US were employed by government, which comprised about 42 percent of the economy (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1949; OECD 2021a). In the Soviet Union, by contrast, most of the working population was employed by the state, which owned close to 100 percent of the economy, but that system turned out to be much less effective at allocating resources. Nevertheless, the size and scope of government spending has gradually expanded in the US and in Europe. In many European economies it now accounts for more than half of the economy. 二战结束后，美国只有约5%的人受雇于政府，而政府占经济总量的42%（美国人口普查局，1949年；OECD 2021a）。相比之下，在苏联，大部分劳动人口受雇于国家，国家拥有接近100%的经济，但这种制度在分配资源方面的效果要差很多。然而，在美国和欧洲，政府支出的规模和范围已经逐渐扩大。在许多欧洲经济体中，政府支出现在占到经济总量的一半以上。 Food, clothing and shelter are obvious solutions to human needs that a UBI should make affordable, but a UBI could eventually also cover the cost of education and healthcare. That might seem ambitious, given how quickly education and healthcare costs have risen over the past decades, but technology can be expected to make both of these far more affordable in the near future. 食物、衣服和住所是明显的解决人类需求的办法，UBI应该使人们能够负担得起，但UBI最终也可以覆盖教育和医疗保健的费用。考虑到教育和医疗费用在过去几十年中的快速增长，这可能看起来很雄心勃勃，但可以预计，在不久的将来，技术会使这两方面的费用更容易负担得起。 Technological Deflation 技术性通货紧缩 If you’re struggling to take care of your needs, the world will seem like an expensive place. Yet the data show that a lot of things have been getting cheaper for some time. In the US, as the chart below shows, the price of consumer durables has been falling since the mid-1990s. 如果你正在努力照顾你的需求，那么这个世界将看起来是一个昂贵的地方。然而，数据显示，一段时间以来，很多东西都在变便宜。在美国，如下图所示，自90年代中期以来，耐用消费品的价格一直在下降。 ​​ Consumer Durables Price Index Source: Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, 2021d The decline in the price of consumer durables has been made possible by technological progress. We are getting better at making stuff, and the automation of production and distribution is a big part of that. While this will hurt you if you lose your job as a result, if you have money to buy things it will help you. And with UBI everyone will have money, which as prices fall over time will buy more and more. 耐用消费品价格的下降是由技术进步促成的。我们在制造东西方面越来越好，而生产和销售的自动化是其中的一个重要部分。虽然如果你因此而失去工作，这将伤害你，但如果你有钱买东西，这将帮助你。而有了UBI，每个人都会有钱，随着时间的推移，价格下降，会买到越来越多的东西。 The decline in the price of consumer durables has made adequate clothing easily affordable. Technology is also driving down the cost of smartphones, which will themselves be essential in making education and healthcare more affordable. This declining trend will only accelerate as we begin to use technology such as additive manufacturing (also known as ‘3D printing’), manufacturing products only when they are needed and close to where they are required (Crane & Marchese, 2015). Additive manufacturing technology is even making it much cheaper to put up a building, with various structures around the world produced in this way in recent years, and one California company now offering small houses 3D printed in 24 hours for sale (Orrall, 2020). 耐用消费品价格的下降使人们很容易买得起足够的衣服。技术也在推动智能手机的成本下降，而智能手机本身将是使教育和医疗更可负担的关键。随着我们开始使用增材制造（也被称为 \"3D打印\"）等技术，这种下降趋势只会加速，只有在需要的时候和靠近需要的地方才能制造产品（Crane & Marchese, 2015）。增材制造技术甚至使建造建筑物的成本大大降低，近年来，世界各地的各种结构都是以这种方式生产的，加利福尼亚的一家公司现在提供24小时内3D打印出来的小房子来出售（Orrall, 2020）。 Another way housing can be made more affordable is through improved sharing of existing housing. Digital technology, including the services offered by companies such as Airbnb and Couchsurfing, make such sharing vastly easier (note: a degree of regulation is required to avoid detrimental impact on some local housing markets). Despite such progress, it still costs a fortune to live in places where demand for housing exceeds the available supply, such as New York and San Francisco. With UBI, people can choose to live where housing is more affordable. 另一种可以使住房更加负担得起的方式是通过改善现有住房的共享。数字技术，包括Airbnb和Couchsurfing等公司提供的服务，使这种共享变得非常容易（注意：需要一定程度的监管，以避免对一些地方住房市场造成不利影响）。尽管取得了这些进展，但在纽约和旧金山等住房需求超过现有供应的地方，居住仍需花费大量资金。有了UBI，人们可以选择居住在住房更容易负担的地方。 In recent years, the city of Detroit gave away houses as an alternative to demolishing them, and in some rural areas of the US you can rent a home for as little as a few hundred dollars per month (Macguire, 2014). In fact, there are around 30 million units renting for less than $600 a month, accounting for 25 percent of the national rental stock (The Joint Center for Housing Studies of Harvard University, 2020). The most affordable way to do this is to share a place with friends. This could simply mean having roommates or go as far as purchasing and fixing up an abandoned village as friends of mine have done in Germany. Many people can’t currently take advantage of these opportunities, since they can’t find a job in these locations. By contrast, UBI provides geographic freedom. People who want to move would no longer be trapped in expensive cities just so they can meet their basic needs (often by holding down multiple jobs). 近年来，底特律市赠送房屋，作为拆除房屋的替代方案，在美国的一些农村地区，你可以以每月仅几百美元的价格租到房子（Macguire，2014）。事实上，大约有3000万个单位的月租金低于600美元，占全国租赁存量的25%（哈佛大学住房研究联合中心，2020）。最实惠的方式是与朋友合租一个地方，这可能只是意味着有室友，或者像我的朋友在德国所做的那样，去购买和修复一个废弃的村庄。许多人目前无法利用这些机会，因为他们在这些地方找不到工作。相比之下，UBI提供了地理上的自由。想搬家的人将不再被困于昂贵的城市，只是为了满足他们的基本需求（通常是通过保持多份工作）。 One large group of people is already free of the constraints of work: retirees. And sure enough, many people move away from expensive cities when they retire, to places where real estate is more affordable. When considering the cost of shelter, rather than analyzing how much people need to pay to live where they live today, we should therefore look at what the cost could be in a world that has UBI. Crucially UBI doesn’t prevent someone from applying their entire payment to whatever rent they are currently paying. That is the great power of providing cash which is completely fungible, meaning it can be used to purchase anything (unlike say a housing voucher which could be applied to housing only). 有一大群人已经摆脱了工作的约束：退休人员。而且可以肯定的是，许多人在退休后会搬离昂贵的城市，到房地产更实惠的地方。在考虑住房成本时，与其分析人们需要支付多少钱才能住在今天的地方，不如看看在一个拥有UBI的世界里，成本会是多少。至关重要的是，UBI并不妨碍人们将他们的全部付款用于他们目前正在支付的任何租金。这就是提供现金的巨大力量，它是完全可替换的，意味着它可以用来购买任何东西（不像住房券那样只能用于住房）。 Food is another area where technology stands to offer massive gains. While some argue that genetically modified foods hold the key to feeding the planet affordably, other near-term breakthroughs don’t carry the potential issues that GMOs pose. Indoor vertical farming, for instance, allows for a precise delivery of nutrients and light to plants, as well as enabling huge increases in future productivity through the use of robotics. It also allows food to be grown much nearer to where it is consumed, reducing the costs associated with transportation. In the extreme, using new hydroponic systems, lettuce, tomatoes and other vegetables can be grown right inside of apartments. Over time, as these innovations progress, they will add up to significant cost reductions and increases in availability of food. 食品是另一个技术可以提供巨大收益的领域。虽然有些人认为，转基因食品是以可承受的价格养活地球的关键，但其他近期的突破并没有转基因生物所带来的潜在问题。例如，室内垂直耕作允许向植物精确输送养分和光照，并通过使用机器人技术使未来的生产力大幅提高。它还允许在离消费地更近的地方种植食物，减少与运输有关的成本。在极端情况下，使用新的水培系统，生菜、西红柿和其他蔬菜可以在公寓内种植。随着时间的推移，随着这些创新的进展，它们将大大降低成本，增加食物的供应。 Technology also promises a dramatic decline in the cost of education. Over the last decade, the availability of online learning resources has grown rapidly, including many free platforms, such as the language learning app Duolingo. In addition to online courses such as edX and Khan Academy, there are millions of blog posts that explain specific topics. And of course, YouTube is bursting with educational videos on a near-infinite range of subjects, from sailing to quantum computing. 技术也承诺了教育成本的大幅下降。在过去十年中，在线学习资源的可用性迅速增长，包括许多免费平台，如语言学习应用程序Duolingo。除了edX和可汗学院等在线课程外，还有数以百万计的博客文章解释特定的主题。当然，YouTube上也充斥着从航海到量子计算等近乎无穷无尽的主题的教育视频。 There is evidence that the exorbitant rise in the cost of college tuition in the US is beginning to slow. When analyzing this data, we must remember that there is a huge amount of inertia in our educational system and job market. Many employers continue to believe they must hire graduates from the best universities, which drives up prices for higher education, with a ripple effect that extends all the way down to private nursery schools. This year, Google announced that they would be offering specialized six-month programs for fifty dollars a month, which they committed to treating as equivalent to four-year college degrees in their own hiring (Bariso, 2020). It will be some time before most students turn to free or affordable online resources for all their learning needs, but at least the possibility now exists. The COVID-19 crisis has shown the potential of online education, with schools all around the world switching from in-person instruction to prevent the pandemic from spreading faster. 有证据表明，美国大学学费的高涨速度开始放缓。在分析这些数据时，我们必须记住，在我们的教育系统和就业市场中存在着巨大的惯性。许多雇主仍然认为他们必须雇用最好的大学的毕业生，这推动了高等教育的价格上涨，其连锁反应一直延伸到私立幼儿园。今年，谷歌宣布他们将提供每月50美元的专业六个月课程，他们承诺在自己的招聘中把这些课程视为等同于四年制大学学位（Bariso, 2020）。在大多数学生转向免费或负担得起的在线资源以满足其所有学习需求之前，还需要一段时间，但至少现在存在这种可能性。COVID-19危机显示了在线教育的潜力，世界各地的学校都改用现场教学，以防止该流行病更快蔓延。 Healthcare is a similar story. Per capita spending in the United States far exceeds that of other countries, having risen much more quickly than the rate of inflation for many years, but that hasn’t translated into better care. For instance, Cuba has for many years had an almost identical life expectancy to the US, despite spending less than a tenth of the amount on healthcare per capita (Hamblin, 2016). Debates have raged as to whether the Affordable Care Act or other legislative interventions will decrease healthcare costs or increase insurance premiums. Regardless of these issues, there are a number of reasons why we can count on progress in digital technology bringing down healthcare costs. 医疗保健也是一个类似的故事。美国的人均支出远远超过其他国家，多年来的增长速度远远超过了通货膨胀率，但这并没有转化为更好的护理。例如，古巴多年来的预期寿命几乎与美国相同，尽管人均医疗支出不到美国的十分之一（Hamblin, 2016）。关于《平价医疗法案》或其他立法干预措施是否会降低医疗成本或增加保险费的争论一直很激烈。不管这些问题如何，我们可以指望数字技术的进步能够降低医疗成本，原因有很多。 ​​ Healthcare Expenditure Per Capita Source: OECD, 2021b First, digital technology can make prices on medical procedures more transparent, enabling more competition to push prices down (this could be assisted further by regulation). Second, with people using technology to track their own health data, we can live healthier lives and require less care, especially over the long term. And third, technology will lead to faster and better diagnosis and treatment. The online medical crowdsourcing platform CrowdMed has helped many people whose conditions previously went undiagnosed or misdiagnosed. The Human Diagnosis Project (Human Dx) is also working on a system to help improve the accuracy of diagnoses. 首先，数字技术可以使医疗程序的价格更加透明，使更多的竞争推动价格下降（这可以通过监管进一步协助）。第二，随着人们使用技术来跟踪自己的健康数据，我们可以生活得更健康，需要更少的护理，特别是长期的护理。第三，技术将导致更快和更好的诊断和治疗。在线医疗众包平台CrowdMed已经帮助了许多人，他们的病情以前没有得到诊断或被误诊。人类诊断项目（Human Dx）也正在开发一个系统，以帮助提高诊断的准确性。 Figure 1 is a platform that lets doctors exchange images and other observations relating to medical cases, and Flatiron Health pools data on oncology patients to enable targeted treatment. In addition, a number of companies are bringing telemedicine into the app era: HealthTap, Doctor On Demand, Teladoc Health and Nurx all promise to dramatically reduce the cost of delivering care. 图1是一个让医生交换与医疗案例有关的图像和其他观察结果的平台，Flatiron Health汇集了肿瘤患者的数据，以实现有针对性的治疗。此外，一些公司正在将远程医疗带入应用时代： HealthTap、Doctor On Demand、Teladoc Health和Nurx都承诺将大幅降低提供医疗服务的成本。 You might think that a large proportion of healthcare cost results from pharmaceuticals rather than doctors’ visits, but in fact in the US they account for only a tenth of total health spending (The American Academy of Actuaries, 2018; OECD, 2019). However, technology will likely drive costs down here, too. One pharma entrepreneur told me about the potential for personalized drugs that could dramatically improve the effectiveness of treatments for a wide range of conditions that account for large expenses, including many cancers, motor neuron disease and Alzheimer’s. And in the longer term, technologies such as CRISPR gene editing will give us unprecedented abilities to fix genetic defects that currently result in large and ongoing expenses, such as cystic fibrosis (Mosse, 2015). 你可能认为医疗费用的很大一部分来自药品而不是医生的诊治，但事实上在美国，药品只占医疗总支出的十分之一（美国精算师协会，2018；经合组织，2019）。然而，技术可能也会推动这里的成本下降。一位制药企业家告诉我，个性化药物的潜力，可以极大地提高各种疾病的治疗效果，这些疾病占了大量的开支，包括许多癌症、运动神经元疾病和阿尔茨海默氏症。从长远来看，CRISPR基因编辑等技术将赋予我们前所未有的能力来修复目前导致大量和持续支出的基因缺陷，如囊性纤维化（Mosse, 2015）。 But Isn't Deflation a Bad Thing? 但通货紧缩不是一件坏事吗？ You might be confused by my presentation of deflation as a positive thing. Economists, after all, tend to portray it as an evil that should be avoided at all costs. They are primarily concerned about growth as measured by GDP, which they argue makes us all better off. They assert that if people anticipate that prices will drop, they will be less likely to spend money, which will decrease output and lead owners of capital to make fewer investments, resulting in less innovation and lower employment. That, in turn, makes people spend even less, causing the economy to contract further. Economists point to Japan as a country that has been experiencing deflation and contracting output. To avoid this scenario, they argue for policies designed to achieve some amount of inflation, including the Federal Reserve’s so-called ‘quantitative easing’, which is intended to expand the supply of money and thus increase the nominal prices of things. 你可能对我把通货紧缩说成是一件积极的事情感到困惑。毕竟，经济学家倾向于把它描绘成一种应该不惜一切代价避免的邪恶。他们主要关注的是以GDP衡量的增长，他们认为这能使我们所有人都过得更好。他们断言，如果人们预计价格会下降，他们就不太可能花钱，这将减少产出，导致资本所有者减少投资，导致创新减少，就业减少。这反过来又会使人们的消费更少，导致经济进一步收缩。经济学家指出，日本是一个一直在经历通货紧缩和产出收缩的国家。为了避免这种情况，他们主张采取旨在实现某种程度的通货膨胀的政策，包括美联储所谓的 \"量化宽松\"，其目的是扩大货币供应，从而提高事物的名义价格。 However, in a world where digital technology drives technological deflation, this reasoning is flawed. GDP is an increasingly problematic measure of progress because it ignores both positive and negative externalities. For instance, on the side of positive externalities, making education and healthcare radically cheaper could lower GDP while clearly making people better off. A second flaw in economists’ reasoning is that it assumes technological progress requires growth in paid production. A great counterexample is open-source software, which has driven a lot of technological progress outside of the traditional economic model. Increases in economic, informational and psychological freedom will allow us to accelerate the knowledge loop, which is the foundation of the progress that enables technological deflation. 然而，在一个数字技术推动技术通缩的世界里，这种推理是有缺陷的。GDP是一个越来越有问题的进步衡量标准，因为它忽略了积极和消极的外部因素。例如，在积极的外部因素方面，使教育和医疗保健从根本上变得更便宜可能会降低GDP，但显然会使人们过得更好。经济学家推理中的第二个缺陷是，它假设技术进步需要有偿生产的增长。一个很好的反例是开源软件，它在传统经济模式之外推动了大量的技术进步。经济、信息和心灵自由的增加将使我们能够加速知识循环，这是实现技术通缩的进步的基础。 Technological deflation is what puts society in a position where UBI becomes both possible and increasingly helpful. The total price of all the solutions that a person requires to take care of their needs has already started to decline, and will be lower still in the future. Technological deflation is what allows people to break out of the job loop. 技术通缩是使社会处于UBI成为可能和越来越有帮助的位置。一个人照顾自己需要的所有解决方案的总价格已经开始下降，并且在未来会更低。技术通缩是让人们走出工作圈的原因。 UBI is Affordable UBI是可以负担得起的 With all this background information, you might wonder how much a universal basic income should be. My working proposal for the United State is $1,000 per month for everyone over the age of 18,$400 per month for everyone over the age of 12 and $200 per month for every child. These numbers might seem low, but bear in mind that the goal of UBI isn’t to make people well off—it’s just to allow them to take care of their needs without being forced into the job loop. Our collective thinking about the amounts required is muddled because we have mistakenly come to embrace the fulfillment of our unlimited wants, instead of focusing on the freedom to find purpose that comes from being able to take care of our needs. In addition to showing that capital is no longer our binding constraint, this is the second crucial reason for the earlier section on re-establishing a clear distinction between wants and needs. We should also remember that technological deflation will make fulfilling our needs progressively cheaper, while UBI won’t be introduced overnight. My numbers are intended to work over time, as some other government programs are phased out and a UBI is phased in. 有了这些背景信息，你可能会想知道全民基本收入应该是多少钱。我对美国的工作建议是：18岁以上的人每月1000美元，12岁以上的人每月400美元，每个孩子每月200美元。这些数字可能看起来很低，但请记住，UBI的目标不是让人们过上好日子--只是让他们能够照顾自己的需求，而不会被迫进入工作圈。我们对所需金额的集体思考是混乱的，因为我们已经错误地接受了满足我们无限的需求，而不是专注于找到目标的自由，这来自于能够照顾到我们的需求。除了表明资本不再是我们的约束性制约因素外，这也是前面关于重新明确区分欲望和需求的第二条关键原因。我们还应该记住，技术通缩将使满足我们的需求逐渐变得更便宜，而UBI不会在一夜之间被引入。我的数字是为了随着时间的推移而发挥作用，因为其他一些政府项目被逐步淘汰，而UBI被逐步引入。 Let’s consider these numbers further. While everyone will spend their UBI in different ways, a possible allocation for an adult might break down roughly as follows on a monthly basis: $400 for housing, $300 for food, $100 for transportation, $50 for clothing, and $50 for Internet access and associated equipment, with the balance spent differently each month (for example, on healthcare as required). 让我们进一步考虑这些数字。虽然每个人都会以不同的方式使用他们的UBI，但对于一个成年人来说，每月可能的分配情况大致如下： 400美元用于住房，300美元用于食品，100美元用于交通，50美元用于服装，50美元用于互联网接入和相关设备，余下的钱每个月花得不一样（例如，根据需要用于医疗保健）。 You might wonder why I propose a lower payment for children and teenagers. The answer is, first, we can meet many of their needs more cheaply than we can for adults. And second, there is historic evidence that the number of children people have is partially determined by economics. UBI should not incentivize adults to have more children, so as to ‘skim’ their income. That’s especially important because, again, we want the birth rate to decline globally so we eventually reach peak population. 你可能想知道为什么我提议降低儿童和青少年的付款额。答案是，首先，我们可以比成人更便宜地满足他们的许多需求。其次，有历史证据表明，人们拥有的孩子的数量部分是由经济决定的。UBI不应该激励成年人生更多的孩子，以便 \"掠夺 \"他们的收入。这一点特别重要，因为我们希望全球的出生率下降，以便我们最终达到人口高峰。 When you calculate how much money would be required to provide a UBI in the United States, based on the 2019 population, you wind up with an annual figure of about $3 trillion (U.S. Census Bureau, 2019). While that is a huge sum, it represents just 14 percent of the economy as measured by GDP in 2019, and under 8 percent of gross output, which measures not just final output but also intermediate steps (U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, 2020; Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, 2021e). Where will this money come from? Two sources: government budgets (paid for by taxes) and money creation. 当你根据2019年的人口计算在美国提供UBI需要多少钱时，你会得到一个每年约3万亿美元的数字（美国人口普查局，2019）。虽然这是一个巨大的数字，但它只占2019年GDP衡量的经济的14%，占总产出的8%以下，总产出不仅衡量最终产出，还衡量中间环节（美国经济分析局，2020年；圣路易斯联邦储备银行，2021e）。这些钱将从哪里来？两个来源：政府预算（由税收支付）和货币创造。 In the US in 2019, the total revenues of all levels of government from taxation and fees were on the order of $5 trillion, so the money for a UBI could, in theory, come from redirecting existing budgets (OECD, 2020). There would then be another $2 trillion of money for critical government activities, such as law enforcement and national defense (the budget for the latter was $0.7 trillion in 2019) (“Military Budget of the United States,” 2020). Setting aside the question of the political process that might allow such a reallocation to be accomplished, it is not ruled out by sheer arithmetic. 2019年，美国各级政府从税收和费用中获得的总收入约为5万亿美元，因此，从理论上讲，UBI的资金可以来自现有预算的调整（OECD，2020）。然后会有另外2万亿美元的资金用于关键的政府活动，如执法和国防（后者的预算在2019年为0.7万亿美元）（\"美国的军事预算\"，2020年）。撇开可能允许这种重新分配的政治进程问题不谈，单从算术上看，它并没有被排除在外。 UBI would also substantially increase government revenues. At the moment, nearly half of all earners don’t get paid enough to owe federal income tax. Once people have a UBI, every dollar earned from work, or from other sources such as interest or capital gains, could be taxed. For instance, if you are currently single and earn $10,000 in employment income, you do not need to file a federal income tax return. With a UBI, that could be taxed at a rate of 25 per cent, generating $2,500 in tax revenue. This could provide as much as $0.3 trillion based on a back-of-the-envelope calculation. People who already pay taxes would of course also effectively be paying back some of their UBI through these taxes. Applying a 25 percent tax rate to that group, which would receive roughly half of all UBI payments, would decrease the required amount by an additional $0.4 trillion. In other words, the net amount required for a UBI with a 25 per cent federal tax rate applied starting with the first dollar earned would about $2.3 trillion. UBI也将大幅增加政府收入。目前，将近一半的收入者没有得到足够的报酬来缴纳联邦所得税。一旦人们有了UBI，从工作中赚取的每一美元，或从其他来源，如利息或资本收益，都可以被征税。例如，如果你目前是单身，工作收入为10000美元，你不需要申报联邦所得税。有了UBI，可以按25%的税率征收，产生2500美元的税收。根据信封上的计算，这可以提供多达0.3万亿美元。当然，已经纳税的人也将通过这些税收有效地偿还他们的一些UBI。对这个群体适用25%的税率，他们将获得大约一半的UBI付款，这将使所需金额再减少0.4万亿美元。换句话说，如果从赚取的第一笔钱开始适用25%的联邦税率，那么UBI所需的净额大约为2.3万亿美元。 Government revenues can also be expanded in ways that accomplish other goals. For instance, we should increase taxation on pollution, in particular greenhouse gas emissions. Taxes are a well-established way of dealing with negative externalities, and we have made good use of this effect. Aggressively taxing cigarettes, for instance, has resulted in diminished consumption and higher gasoline taxes in Europe have contributed to more efficient cars. Estimates of the potential revenue from a carbon tax are around $0.3 trillion per year, and might be even higher. So, between offsets from income tax (which would occur automatically) and a greenhouse gas tax (which we need anyway), the funds needed for UBI could be reduced to about $2 trillion. Though that’s a massive number, social security and Medicare/Medicaid each cost about $1 trillion. So in the extreme, UBI could be financed through a massive reallocation of existing programs. 政府收入也可以通过实现其他目标的方式来扩大。例如，我们应该增加对污染的征税，特别是温室气体排放。税收是处理负外部性的一种成熟的方式，我们已经很好地利用了这种效果。例如，对香烟积极征税的结果是减少了消费，欧洲较高的汽油税促进了更高效的汽车。据估计，碳税的潜在收入约为每年0.3万亿美元，甚至可能更高。因此，在所得税（将自动发生）和温室气体税（反正我们需要）的抵消之间，UBI所需的资金可以减少到大约2万亿美元。虽然这是一个巨大的数字，但社会保险和医疗保险/医疗补助的费用都在1万亿美元左右。因此，在极端情况下，UBI可以通过对现有项目的大规模重新分配来获得资金。 There is, however, another way to provide much or all of the money needed for UBI. This solution would require moving away from today’s banking system, where the power to ‘create’ money is delegated to banks, to a system where money is issued directly to people instead. In today’s fractional reserve banking system, commercial banks extend more credit than they have deposits, with the Federal Reserve Bank acting as the so-called lender of last resort. For instance, in the 2008 financial crisis, the Fed bought up potentially bad assets to provide banks with liquidity. Europe too has had a policy of ‘quantitative easing’ (often abbreviated as QE), where a central bank infuses large amounts of money directly into commercial banks through loans and asset purchases on highly favorable terms, in the hope that the banks in turn will use this money to extend loans. 然而，还有一种方法可以提供UBI所需的大部分或全部资金。这个解决方案需要摆脱今天的银行系统，在这个系统中，\"创造 \"货币的权力被委托给银行，而改为直接向人们发行货币。在今天的部分准备金银行系统中，商业银行提供的信贷比他们的存款多，联邦储备银行作为所谓的最后贷款人。例如，在2008年的金融危机中，美联储购买了潜在的不良资产，为银行提供流动性。欧洲也有 \"量化宽松 \"政策（通常缩写为QE），即中央银行通过贷款和以非常优惠的条件购买资产，直接向商业银行注入大量资金，希望银行反过来用这些钱来发放贷款。 The idea is that by extending loans to businesses that need to finance the purchase of equipment or that require more working capital (to hire more salespeople, for example), banks will help the economy grow. But while banks have done that to some degree, they have increasingly focused on lending to large corporations and to wealthy people, to acquire second homes or even for financial speculation. Meanwhile, poor people have virtually no access to affordable credit, and lending to small businesses has been decreasing. The net result has been a rise in wealth and income inequality. Interestingly, this lopsided effect of bank-based money creation was understood as early as the 18th century in the writings of the French banker and economist Richard Cantillon, and has become known as the ‘Cantillon Effect’ (Stoller, 2020). 这个想法是，通过向需要资助购买设备或需要更多营运资金（例如，雇用更多销售人员）的企业提供贷款，银行将帮助经济增长。但是，虽然银行在某种程度上做到了这一点，但它们越来越注重向大公司和富人提供贷款，用于购买第二套住房，甚至用于金融投机。与此同时，穷人几乎没有机会获得可负担得起的信贷，对小企业的贷款一直在减少。净结果是财富和收入不平等的增加。有趣的是，早在18世纪，法国银行家和经济学家理查德-坎蒂隆（Richard Cantillon）的著作中就理解了这种基于银行的货币创造的片面效应，并被称为 \"坎蒂隆效应\"（Stoller，2020）。 An alternative system would be to take money creation out of the hands of banks by forcing them to hold demand deposits at the Fed, or the corresponding central bank, in other countries. Known as ‘full-reserve banking,’ this system dramatically reduces risk in the banking sector by eliminating the possibility of bank runs and allows for new competitive banks to be formed without big upfront equity requirements. Credit extension would take place on the basis of long term deposits, and also happen via marketplace lending, as enabled by companies such as LendingClub, for individuals, and Funding Circle, for businesses. Money creation would happen simply by giving the new money directly to people as part of their UBI payments, a system sometimes referred to as “QE for the people.” 另一种制度是将货币创造从银行手中拿走，迫使它们在美联储或其他国家的相应中央银行持有活期存款。这种制度被称为 \"全额准备金银行\"，通过消除银行挤兑的可能性，大大降低了银行部门的风险，并允许新的有竞争力的银行成立，而没有大的前期股权要求。信贷扩展将在长期存款的基础上进行，并通过市场借贷进行，如针对个人的LendingClub和针对企业的Funding Circle等公司。货币的创造将仅仅通过将新的货币直接给人们作为他们的UBI支付的一部分来实现，这个系统有时被称为 \"为人民服务的QE\"。 What orders of magnitude are we talking about? The terms M0, M1, M2 and M3 are progressively more encompassing measures of how much money has been created in the economy (meaning M3 is greater than M2, which is greater than M1, etc.). In the US, we no longer track the larger monetary aggregates, such as M3, and only use narrower measures, such as M2, and even that measure has been growing by about $1 trillion each year over the last decade. Since the beginning of the COVID-19 crisis, the Federal Reserve has created an astonishing additional $15 trillion of money as measured by M1. 我们谈论的是什么数量级？M0、M1、M2和M3这些术语是对经济中所创造的货币数量的渐进式的衡量（意味着M3大于M2，而M2又大于M1，等等）。在美国，我们不再跟踪较大的货币总量，如M3，而只使用较窄的衡量标准，如M2，即使这个衡量标准在过去十年中每年也增长约1万亿美元。自19世纪初的危机以来，美联储已经创造了惊人的额外15万亿美元的货币，以M1衡量。 Another way to get a sense of the total magnitude of money creation is by considering the development of debt. US households have about $10 trillion in mortgage debt, $1.2 trillion in auto loans, over $1.5 trillion in student loans and more than $900 million in credit card debt (Federal Reserve Bank of New York, 2020; Fontinelle, 2021; White, 2021). Total household debt can increase by as much as $1 trillion in a single year. US business debt stands at around $35 trillion, about half of which is in the financial sector (Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, 2021f; 2021g). 另一个了解货币创造总规模的方法是考虑债务的发展。美国家庭有大约10万亿美元的抵押贷款债务，1.2万亿美元的汽车贷款，超过1.5万亿美元的学生贷款和超过9亿美元的信用卡债务（纽约联邦储备银行，2020；Fontinelle，2021；White，2021）。家庭债务总额在一年内可以增加多达1万亿美元。美国企业债务约为35万亿美元，其中约有一半在金融部门（圣路易斯联邦储备银行，2021f；2021g）。 The amount of money created annually is thus in the same ballpark as my proposed UBI. Historically, the idea of the government ‘printing’ money is associated with fears of runaway inflation of the sort that occurred in Germany’s Weimar Republic. There are several reasons why this would not be the case with a proper UBI scheme. First, the amount of new money created would be fixed and known in advance. Second, as we saw earlier, technology is a strong deflationary force. Third, the net amount of money created can be reduced over time by removing money from the economy, which could be accomplished through negative interest rates on bank deposits above a certain amount, with payment collected by the central bank. Alternatively, a system of ‘demurrage’ could be implemented, in which a fee is levied on all currency holdings or the holdings are automatically shrunk (with digital currencies, the latter is now possible automatically). 因此，每年创造的货币量与我提议的UBI处于同一水平。从历史上看，政府 \"印刷 \"货币的想法与对德国魏玛共和国发生的那种失控的通货膨胀的担忧有关。有几个原因可以说明为什么一个适当的UBI计划不会出现这种情况。首先，新创造的货币数量将是固定的，并且是事先知道的。第二，正如我们前面所看到的，技术是一种强大的通缩力量。第三，随着时间的推移，创造的货币净额可以通过从经济中移除货币来减少，这可以通过对超过一定数额的银行存款实行负利率来实现，并由中央银行收取费用。另外，还可以实施 \"滞纳金 \"制度，对所有货币持有量征收费用，或者自动缩减持有量（有了数字货币，后者现在可以自动实现）。 I expect the path to UBI to involve some combination of changes to government budgets, taxation and the monetary system. As we will see later it is also possible that UBI emerges outside of government through a decentralized project using blockchain technology. However we wind up getting there, my back-of-the-envelope calculations above show that UBI is affordable in the United States today. Similar calculations have been carried out for other countries and show affordability even in many lesser developed countries. Economic freedom for all is already within our reach. 我预计通向UBI的道路将涉及政府预算、税收和货币体系的一些组合变化。正如我们将在后面看到的那样，UBI也有可能在政府之外通过使用区块链技术的分散项目出现。无论我们如何达到这个目的，我的上述逆向计算表明，UBI在今天的美国是可以承受的。其他国家也进行了类似的计算，显示即使在许多较不发达的国家也能负担得起。所有人的经济自由已经在我们的掌控之中。 Impact of UBI on the Labor Market UBI对劳动力市场的影响 One of the many attractive features of UBI is that it doesn’t remove people’s ability to sell their labor. Suppose someone offers you $5 per hour to look after their dog. Under UBI you are completely free to accept or reject that proposal, without distortion from a minimum wage. The reason we need a minimum wage in the current system is to guard against exploitation, but this problem exists primarily because people do not have the option to walk away from exploitive employment. If UBI was in place, they would. UBI的许多吸引人的特点之一是，它不会消除人们出售其劳动力的能力。假设有人向你提供每小时5美元的服务，让你照看他们的狗。在UBI下，你可以完全自由地接受或拒绝这一提议，而不会受到最低工资的扭曲。在目前的制度下，我们需要最低工资的原因是为了防止剥削，但这个问题的存在主要是因为人们没有选择离开剥削性的工作。如果UBI到位，他们会的。 The example of dog-sitting shows why a minimum wage is a crude instrument that results in distortion. If you like dogs, you might happily take the work for $5 per hour. You might be able to do it while writing a blog post or watching videos on YouTube. Government should not interfere with such transactions. The same is true of working in a fast food restaurant. If employees have the option of walking away from a job, the labor market will naturally find out how much it takes to get someone to work at, say, McDonalds. That might turn out to be $5 per hour or it might turn out to be $30 per hour (the former being exceedingly unlikely for McDonalds but might be the case for a local burger joint that people love working at). Finally, with the existence of UBI labor organizing for collective bargaining would become easier, as various tactics currently used by employers rely on the threat of unemployment and the large demand for even poorly compensated jobs from the ‘precariat’ (a term used by Guy Standing to describe the growing group of people who lead a precarious existence as the result of intermittent employment and other forms of underemployment). 看狗的例子说明了为什么最低工资是一个粗略的工具，会导致扭曲。如果你喜欢狗，你可能会高兴地接受每小时5美元的工作。你也许可以在写博客文章或在YouTube上看视频的时候做这件事。政府不应干涉这种交易。在快餐店工作的情况也是如此。如果员工可以选择离开工作，劳动力市场自然会发现需要多少钱才能让人在例如麦当劳工作。结果可能是每小时5美元，也可能是每小时30美元（对于麦当劳来说，前者是极不可能的，但对于人们喜欢工作的当地汉堡店来说，可能是这样的）。最后，随着UBI的存在，劳工组织的集体谈判将变得更加容易，因为雇主目前使用的各种策略依赖于失业的威胁，以及 \"precariat\"（Guy Standing使用的一个术语，描述越来越多的人由于间歇性就业和其他形式的就业不足而导致的不稳定的生活）对即使是报酬低的工作的大量需求。 One concern often expressed about UBI is that people would stop working altogether and cause the labor market to collapse. Experiments with UBI, such as the Manitoba Basic Annual Income Experiment in Canada in the 1970s, showed that while people somewhat reduced their working hours when they were paid such income, there was no dramatic labor shortage. People will generally want to earn more than their basic income provides, and the increase in the price of labor will make working more attractive. Furthermore, in conjunction with the income tax change discussed in the previous section, UBI avoids a major issue with many existing welfare programs in which people lose their entire benefit when they start to work, resulting in effective tax rates above 100 per cent (i.e. people make less working than not). With UBI, whatever you earn is in addition to your basic income and you pay the normal marginal tax rate on that. There is no benefit cliff and hence no disincentive to paid work. 对UBI经常表达的一个担忧是，人们会完全停止工作，导致劳动力市场的崩溃。关于UBI的实验，如1970年代加拿大的马尼托巴省基本年收入实验，表明虽然人们在获得这种收入时多少会减少工作时间，但并没有出现戏剧性的劳动力短缺。人们一般会想赚取比基本收入更多的钱，而劳动力价格的提高会使工作更有吸引力。此外，结合上一节讨论的所得税变化，UBI避免了许多现有福利项目的一个主要问题，即人们在开始工作时失去了他们的全部福利，导致有效税率超过100％（即人们工作比不工作赚得少）。有了UBI，无论你赚多少钱，都是在你的基本收入之外的，你要为此支付正常的边际税率。没有福利悬崖，因此没有对有偿工作的抑制作用。 But what about dirty or dangerous jobs? Will there be a price of labor high enough to motivate anyone to do them, and will the companies that need this labor be able to stay in business? Businesses will have a choice between paying people more to do such work or investing in automation. In all likelihood, the answer will be a combination of both. As we already saw earlier, expensive labor has historically been a driver of innovation. Because our ability to automate has gone up dramatically with digital technology we can in fact now automate these dirty and dangerous jobs. That also means that we do not have to worry about labor-price induced inflation. Put differently, technological deflation can continue even if the cost for some labor increases. 但是，那些肮脏或危险的工作怎么办？是否会有足够高的劳动力价格来激励人们去做这些工作，而需要这些劳动力的公司是否能够保持业务？企业将有一个选择，是向人们支付更多的钱来做这些工作，还是投资于自动化。在所有的可能性中，答案将是两者的结合。正如我们前面已经看到的，昂贵的劳动力在历史上一直是创新的驱动力。由于我们的自动化能力随着数字技术的发展而大幅提高，我们现在实际上可以将这些肮脏和危险的工作自动化。这也意味着，我们不必担心劳动力价格引起的通货膨胀。换句话说，即使一些劳动力的成本增加，技术通缩也可以继续。 UBI would have three other important impacts on the labor market. The first has to do with volunteering. Currently, there are not enough people looking after the environment or taking care of the sick and elderly. Labor is frequently undersupplied in these sectors, because the demand isn’t backed by enough money, and these activities thus rely largely on donations. Many elderly people don’t have sufficient savings to afford personal care. When people have to work pretty much every free hour to meet their needs they don’t have time to volunteer. Providing them with UBI could vastly increase the number of volunteers (we observe increased volunteering among pensioners, who are effectively already on a UBI). UBI将对劳动力市场产生其他三个重要影响。第一个是与志愿服务有关。目前，没有足够的人照顾环境或照顾病人和老人。这些部门的劳动力经常供不应求，因为需求没有足够的资金支持，因此这些活动主要依靠捐赠。许多老人没有足够的储蓄来负担个人护理。当人们不得不在几乎每一个空闲时间工作以满足他们的需求时，他们就没有时间做志愿者了。为他们提供UBI可以大大增加志愿者的数量（我们观察到养老金领取者的志愿服务有所增加，他们实际上已经在享受UBI）。 The second big effect UBI would have on the labor market is a dramatic expansion of the scope for entrepreneurial activity. A lot of people who would like to start a local business, such as a nail salon or a restaurant, have no financial cushion and can never quit their jobs to give it a try. I sometimes refer to UBI as ‘seed money for everyone’: more businesses getting started in a community would mean more opportunities for fulfilling local employment. UBI对劳动力市场的第二大影响是极大地扩大了创业活动的范围。很多想在当地创业的人，如美甲店或餐馆，都没有经济上的缓冲，也不可能辞掉工作去尝试一下。我有时把UBI称为 \"每个人的种子资金\"：在一个社区中，更多的企业开始运作，这意味着更多的机会可以满足当地的就业。 Once they get going, some of these new ventures would receive traditional financing, including bank loans and venture capital, but UBI also has the potential to significantly expand the reach and importance of crowdfunding. If you feel confident that your needs are taken care of, you will be more likely to start an activity that has the potential to attract support via crowdfunding, such as recording music videos and putting them up on YouTube. Also, if your needs are taken care of, you will be more likely to use a fraction of any income you receive on top of UBI to support crowdfunded projects. 一旦他们开始行动，这些新企业中的一些将获得传统的融资，包括银行贷款和风险资本，但UBI也有可能大大扩展众筹的范围和重要性。如果你觉得自己的需求得到了照顾，你将更有可能开始一项有可能通过众筹吸引支持的活动，比如录制音乐视频并将其放在YouTube上。另外，如果你的需求得到了满足，你将更有可能将你在UBI之外获得的任何收入的一小部分用于支持众筹项目。 The third big impact of UBI on the labor market would be the growth of human qua human jobs (credit for this concept goes to Yochai Benkler, who mentioned it to me in a conversation). There are certain jobs that even when we can automate them we will sometimes have a preference for a human instead. Examples of these include food preparation and serving, massage and mental health therapy, and of course arts and crafts. A great example for this desire is the persistence and even growth of live music following the invention of sound recording. There is something special about a performance that results from a sense of shared humanity. It is our intuitive understanding that the performer has an inner life of thoughts and emotions akin to our own that makes live music special. Conversely it can be highly pleasurable to perform for somebody or to cook a meal for someone. UBI will greatly increase the room for people to participate on both sides of these human qua human labor markets. UBI对劳动力市场的第三大影响是人与人之间工作的增长（这个概念归功于Yochai Benkler，他在一次谈话中向我提到了这个概念）。有一些工作，即使我们可以将其自动化，我们有时也会倾向于用人来代替。这些例子包括食物准备和服务，按摩和心理健康治疗，当然还有艺术和工艺。这种愿望的一个很好的例子是，在发明了录音之后，现场音乐的坚持甚至发展。一场表演有一些特别之处，它是很多的人性感产生的。正是我们的直觉理解，表演者有一个类似于我们自己的思想和情感的内在生活，使现场音乐变得特别。反过来说，为某人表演或为某人做饭也是非常愉快的。UBI将大大增加人们参与这些人与人之间的劳动市场的空间。 Other Objections to UBI 对UBI的其他反对意见 I have addressed the three biggest objections to UBI by showing that it is affordable, that it will not result in inflation, and that it will have a positive impact on the labor market and innovation. There are some other common objections that are worth addressing, including a moral objection that people have done nothing to deserve such an income, which is answered in its own section below. 我已经解决了对UBI的三个最大的反对意见，表明它是可以负担得起的，它不会导致通货膨胀，以及它将对劳动力市场和创新产生积极影响。还有一些其他常见的反对意见也值得讨论，包括道德上的反对意见，即人们没有做任何事情来配得上这样的收入，这一点将在下面的独立章节中回答。 One other objection to UBI is that it diminishes the value of work in society. In fact the opposite is true: UBI recognizes how much unpaid work exists in the world, including child rearing. We have created a situation where the word ‘work’ has become synonymous with getting paid. As things stand, if you don’t get paid for doing something, it’s not considered work. An example of another approach is the one taken by Montessori Schools, which base their teaching on creativity and problem-solving: they use “work” to refer to any “purposeful activity.” 对UBI的另一个反对意见是，它降低了社会中工作的价值。事实上，情况恰恰相反： UBI认识到世界上存在多少无偿工作，包括养育子女。我们已经创造了一种情况，\"工作 \"一词已经成为获得报酬的同义词。按照目前的情况，如果你做某件事情没有得到报酬，那就不被认为是工作。另一个例子是蒙台梭利学校采取的方法，他们的教学基于创造力和解决问题：他们用 \"工作 \"来指任何 \"有目的的活动\"。 A further objection is that UBI robs people of the sense of purpose that work provides if they stop working or stop looking for work. However, the idea of work as a source of human purpose is a relatively new one, and it is largely attributable to the Protestant work ethic. Earlier, human purpose tended to be rooted in religion, which offered meaning in return for adhering to certain precepts (those might include work as one of several commandments, but not as a source of purpose in itself). The source of human purpose is thus subject to redefinition over time. As we transition to the Knowledge Age, contributing to or sustaining the knowledge loop is a more suitable focus. So is carrying out the responsibilities that we as humans have because of the power that knowledge has given to us. 另一个反对意见是，如果人们停止工作或停止寻找工作，UBI就会剥夺工作所带来的目的感。然而，将工作作为人类目的的来源是一个相对较新的想法，它主要归因于新教的工作伦理。早些时候，人类的目的往往植根于宗教，宗教为遵守某些戒律提供意义（这些戒律可能包括作为几条戒律之一的工作，但本身不是目的的来源）。因此，人类目的的来源随着时间的推移会被重新定义。当我们过渡到知识时代时，为知识圈做贡献或维持知识圈是一个更合适的焦点。履行我们作为人类的责任也是如此，因为知识赋予我们的力量。 One other frequent objection is that people will spend their basic income on alcohol and drugs, an assertion often accompanied by claims that the casino money received by Native Americans has caused drug problems among that population. There is no evidence to support this objection: no UBI pilots have found a significant increase in drug or alcohol abuse, and in the meantime the opioid crisis has been the largest drug epidemic in US history. Research shows that, contrary to widely held belief, casino money has contributed to declines in obesity, smoking and heavy drinking (Wolfe et al., 2012). 另一个经常出现的反对意见是，人们会把基本收入花在酒精和毒品上，这种说法往往伴随着美国原住民收到的赌场钱在该人群中造成了毒品问题。没有证据支持这种反对意见：没有任何UBI试点发现毒品或酒精滥用的明显增加，同时，阿片类药物危机已经成为美国历史上最大的毒品流行病。研究表明，与人们普遍认为的相反，赌场的钱促进了肥胖、吸烟和大量饮酒的减少（Wolfe等人，2012）。 Some people object to UBI not because they think it won’t work, but because they claim it is a cynical ploy by the rich to silence the poor and keep them from rebelling. Some who voice this criticism genuinely believe it, but others use it as a tool of political division. Whatever the case, the impact of UBI is likely to be the opposite, as Thomas Paine recognized. In many parts of the world, including the United States, the poor are effectively excluded from the political process. They are too busy holding down one or more jobs to be able to run for office—or sometimes even to vote. American elections are held on a weekday, and employers are not required to give employees time off work to go to the polling station. Outside of elections many democratic processes, such as organizing protests or even strikes, relies on people who can contribute time to the effort. UBI will dramatically improve the ability of people to engage this way and thus challenge the status quo. 有些人反对UBI，并不是因为他们认为它不会成功，而是因为他们声称这是富人压制穷人并阻止他们反抗的一个狡猾的伎俩。一些提出这种批评的人真正相信它，但其他人则将其作为政治分裂的工具。不管是什么情况，UBI的影响很可能是相反的，正如托马斯-潘恩所认识到的。在世界的许多地方，包括美国，穷人实际上被排除在政治进程之外。他们忙于从事一份或多份工作，无法参加竞选，有时甚至无法投票。美国的选举是在工作日举行的，雇主不需要给雇员放假去投票站。在选举之外的许多民主进程，如组织抗议甚至罢工，都依赖于能够为之贡献时间的人。UBI将极大地提高人们以这种方式参与的能力，从而挑战现状。 UBI as a Moral Imperative UBI是一种道义上的要求 Before we examine informational freedom, we should remind ourselves why individuals deserve to have enough to take care of their needs, regardless of any economic contributions they may have made. 在我们研究信息自由之前，我们应该提醒自己，为什么个人应该有足够的能力来照顾他们的需求，无论他们可能做出的任何经济贡献。 Consider the air we breathe. None of us did anything to make it: we just inherited it from the planet. Similarly, no one who is alive today did anything to invent electricity. It had already been invented, and we have inherited its benefits. You might point out that electricity costs money and people have to pay for it, but they pay for the cost of producing it rather than the cost of its invention. Here we might substitute many other amazing examples of our collectively inherited human knowledge, such as antibiotics, the wheel, sliced bread, etc. 考虑一下我们所呼吸的空气。我们没有人做任何事情来制造它：我们只是从地球上继承了它。同样地，今天活着的人没有做任何事情来发明电。它已经被发明了，而我们继承了它的好处。你可能会指出，电是要花钱的，人们必须为它付钱，但他们支付的是生产电的成本，而不是电的发明成本。在这里，我们可以用许多其他惊人的例子来代替我们集体继承的人类知识，如抗生素、车轮、切片面包等。 We are incredibly fortunate to have been born into a world where capital is no longer scarce. This means that using our knowledge to take care of everyone’s needs is a moral imperative. UBI accomplishes that by giving people economic freedom, allowing them to escape the job loop, and accelerating the knowledge loop that gave us this incredible knowledge in the first place. 我们非常幸运地出生在一个资本不再稀缺的世界里。这意味着，利用我们的知识来照顾每个人的需求是一种道德上的要求。UBI通过给予人们经济自由来实现这一目标，使他们能够摆脱工作循环，并加速知识循环，首先给了我们这些不可思议的知识。 "},"docs/Part_Four_Enhancing_Freedom/Informational_Freedom.html":{"url":"docs/Part_Four_Enhancing_Freedom/Informational_Freedom.html","title":"信息自由","keywords":"","body":"信息自由 Can you read any book you want to at the push of a button? Can you listen to any music ever recorded the moment you feel like it? Do you have instant access to any academic publication from around the world that you wish to consult? In the past, when copying and distributing information was expensive, asking such seemingly outrageous questions would not have made any sense. In the early days of writing, when books were copied by hand, they were rare, costly and subject to errors. Very few people had access to them. And even as recently as the last years of the 20th century, it typically took physically costly processes of production and distribution to get books, musical recordings and other items into people’s hands. 你能在按下按钮时阅读任何你想读的书吗？你能在你想听的时候听任何曾经录制的音乐吗？你是否可以即时获得你想查阅的世界各地的任何学术出版物？在过去，当复制和传播信息的成本很高时，问这种看似离谱的问题是没有任何意义的。在写作的早期，当书籍被手工复制时，它们是罕见的，昂贵的，而且有可能出现错误。很少有人能接触到它们。即使在最近的20世纪最后几年，要把书本、音乐唱片和其他物品送到人们手中，通常需要花费大量的物理生产和分配过程。 But in the digital age, when the marginal cost of making and distributing a copy has shrunk to zero, all limitations on digital information are artificial. They involve adding costs to the system in order to impose scarcity on something that is abundant. For example, billions of dollars have been spent on preventing people from copying and sharing digital music files (CBS News, 2001). 但在数字时代，当制作和分发一份拷贝的边际成本已经缩减到零时，对数字信息的所有限制都是人为的。它们涉及到给系统增加成本，以便对丰富的东西施加稀缺性。例如，为了防止人们复制和分享数字音乐文件，已经花费了数十亿美元（CBS新闻，2001）。 Why are we spending money to make information less accessible? When information existed only in analog form, the cost of copying and distributing it allowed us to build an economy and a society that was based on information scarcity. A record label, for instance, had to recruit musical talent, record in expensive studios, market the music, and make and distribute physical records. Charging for the records allowed the label to cover its costs and turn a profit. Now that individuals can make music on a laptop and distribute it for free, the fixed costs are dramatically lower and the marginal cost of each listen is zero. In this context, the business model of charging per record, per song or per listen, and the copyright protections required to sustain it, no longer make sense. Despite the ridiculous fight put up by the music industry, our listening is generally either free (meaning that it is ad-supported) or part of a subscription. In either case, the marginal cost of each listen is zero. 为什么我们要花钱让信息更难获取？当信息只以模拟形式存在时，复制和传播信息的成本使我们能够建立一个基于信息稀缺性的经济和社会。例如，一个唱片公司必须招募音乐人才，在昂贵的录音室录音，推销音乐，并制作和分发实体唱片。对唱片的收费使唱片公司能够支付其成本并实现盈利。现在，个人可以在笔记本电脑上制作音乐并免费分发，固定成本大大降低，每次收听的边际成本为零。在这种情况下，按唱片、按歌曲或按收听次数收费的商业模式，以及维持这种模式所需的版权保护，不再有意义了。尽管音乐产业进行了荒谬的斗争，但我们的收听通常要么是免费的（意味着它是广告支持的），要么是订阅的一部分。在这两种情况下，每次收听的边际成本都是零。 Despite this progress in the music industry, we accept many other artificial restrictions on information access because this is the only system we know. To transition into the Knowledge Age, however, we should strive for an increase in informational freedom. This is not unprecedented in human history: prior to the advent of the printing press, stories and music were passed on orally or through copying by hand. There were no restrictions on who could tell a story or perform a song. 尽管在音乐行业取得了这一进展，我们还是接受了许多其他对信息获取的人为限制，因为这是我们唯一知道的系统。然而，为了过渡到知识时代，我们应该努力增加知识自由。这在人类历史上并非没有先例：在印刷术出现之前，故事和音乐是通过口头或手抄的方式传递的。对于谁能讲故事或表演歌曲，没有任何限制。 To be clear, information is not the same as knowledge. Information, for instance, includes the huge number of log files generated every day by computers around the world, many of which may never be analyzed. We don’t know in advance what information will turn out to be the basis for knowledge, so it makes sense to retain as much information as possible and make access to it as broad as possible. This section will explore various ways in which we can expand informational freedom, the second important step that will facilitate our transition to a Knowledge Age. 要明确的是，信息不等同于知识。例如，信息包括世界各地的计算机每天产生的大量日志文件，其中许多可能永远不会被分析。我们事先不知道哪些信息会变成知识的基础，所以尽可能多地保留信息并使其获得尽可能广泛的访问是有意义的。本节将探讨我们可以扩大信息自由的各种方式，这是促进我们向信息时代过渡的第二个重要步骤。 Access to the Internet 接入互联网 The Internet has been derided by some who claim it is a small innovation compared to, say, electricity or vaccinations—but they are mistaken. The Internet allows anyone, anywhere in the world, to learn how electricity or vaccinations work. Setting aside artificial limitations imposed on the flow of information, the Internet provides the means to access and distribute all human knowledge to all of humanity. As such, it is the crucial enabler of the digital knowledge loop. Access to the Internet is a core component of informational freedom. 互联网一直被一些人嘲笑，他们声称与电力或疫苗接种相比，互联网是一个小的创新，但他们错了。互联网允许任何人，在世界任何地方，了解电力或疫苗的工作原理。抛开对信息流的人为限制，互联网提供了向全人类获取和传播所有人类知识的手段。因此，它是数字知识圈的重要推动者。访问互联网是知识自由的核心组成部分。 At present, over four and half billion people are connected to the Internet, a number that is increasing by hundreds of millions every year (Kemp, 2020). This tremendous growth has become possible because the cost of access has fallen dramatically. A capable smartphone costs less than $100 to manufacture. In places with competitive markets, 4G bandwidth is provided at prices as low as $0.10 per GB (Roy, 2019). 目前，超过45亿人连接到互联网，这个数字每年都在以亿计的速度增长（Kemp，2020）。这种巨大的增长之所以成为可能，是因为接入的成本已经大幅下降。一部有能力的智能手机的制造成本不到100美元。在有竞争性市场的地方，提供4G带宽的价格低至每GB 0.10美元（Roy, 2019）。 Even connecting people who live in remote parts of the world is getting much cheaper, as the cost for wireless networking is decreasing and we are increasing our satellite capacity. For instance, there is a project underway to connect rural communities in Mexico for less than $10,000 per community (Rostad, 2018). At the same time, in highly developed economies such as the US, ongoing technological innovation such as MIMO wireless technology will further lower prices for bandwidth in densely populated urban areas (“MIMO,” 2020). 即使是连接生活在世界偏远地区的人，也变得更加便宜，因为无线网络的成本正在下降，我们正在增加我们的卫星容量。例如，有一个项目正在进行，以每个社区不到10,000美元的价格连接墨西哥的农村社区（Rostad，2018）。同时，在美国等高度发达的经济体，正在进行的技术创新，如MIMO无线技术，将进一步降低人口稠密的城市地区的带宽价格（\"MIMO\"，2020）。 All of this means that even at relatively low levels, UBI would cover the cost of Internet access, provided that we keep innovating and maintain highly competitive and properly regulated markets for access to it. This is an example of how the three different freedoms reinforce each other: economic freedom allows people to access the Internet, which is the foundation for informational freedom, and, as we will see later, using it to contribute to the knowledge loop requires psychological freedom. 所有这些都意味着，即使在相对较低的水平上，UBI也会覆盖互联网接入的成本，只要我们不断创新，并保持高度竞争和适当监管的市场来访问它。这是三个不同的自由如何相互促进的例子：经济自由使人们能够访问互联网，这是知识自由的基础，而且，正如我们在后面看到的，使用它来促进知识循环需要心灵自由。 As we work to make affordable Internet access universal, we must also address limitations to the flow of information on the network. In particular, we should fight against restrictions on the Internet imposed by governments and Internet service providers (ISPs). Both are artificial limitations, driven by a range of economic and policy considerations opposed to the imperative of informational freedom. 在我们努力普及负担得起的互联网接入时，我们还必须解决网络信息流动的限制。特别是，我们应该与政府和互联网服务提供商（ISP）对互联网的限制作斗争。这两种限制都是人为的，是由一系列与信息自由的必要性相对立的经济和政策考虑驱动的。 One Global Internet 一个全球互联网 By design, the Internet has no built-in concept of geography. Most fundamentally, it constitutes a way to connect networks with one another (hence its name), regardless of where the machines involved are located. Any geographic restrictions have been added in, often at great cost. Australia and the UK have recently mandated so-called ‘firewalls’ around their countries, not unlike China’s own “Great Firewall” (“Great Firewall,” 2020), and countries like Turkey have had one in place for some time. These ‘firewalls’ place the Internet under government control, restricting informational freedom. For instance, Wikipedia was not accessible in Turkey for many years. Furthermore, both China and Russia have banned the use virtual private network services, tools that allow individuals to circumvent these artificial restrictions (Wenger, 2017a). As citizens, we should be outraged that governments are cutting us off from accessing information freely around the world, both on principle and on the basis of this being a bad use of resources. Imagine governments in an earlier age spending taxpayer money so citizens could dial fewer phone numbers. 根据设计，互联网没有内置的地理概念。最根本的是，它构成了一种将网络相互连接的方式（因此而得名），而不管相关的机器位于何处。任何地理上的限制都是被加进去的，往往要付出巨大的代价。澳大利亚和英国最近强制要求在其国家周围建立所谓的 \"防火墙\"，与中国自己的 \"长城\"（\"长城\"，2020年）并不一样，土耳其等国家已经建立了一段时间。这些 \"防火墙 \"将互联网置于政府控制之下，限制了信息自由。例如，维基百科在土耳其有很多年不能访问。此外，中国和俄罗斯都禁止使用虚拟私人网络服务，这是允许个人规避这些人为限制的工具（Wenger, 2017a）。作为公民，我们应该对政府切断我们在世界各地自由获取信息的途径感到愤怒，这既是基于原则，也是基于这是对资源的一种不良利用。想象一下，在更早的时代，政府花纳税人的钱，让公民可以少拨一些电话号码。 No Artificial Fast and Slow Lanes 没有人为的快车道和慢车道 The same equipment used by governments to impose geographic boundaries on the Internet is used by ISPs to extract more money from customers, distorting access in the process through practices including paid prioritization and zero-rating. To understand why they are a problem, let’s take a brief technical detour. 政府用来在互联网上强加地理界限的设备，也被互联网服务供应商用来从客户那里榨取更多的钱，在这个过程中，通过包括付费优先和零等级的做法，扭曲了访问。为了理解为什么它们是一个问题，让我们在技术上做一个简短的迂回。 When you buy access to the Internet, you pay for a connection of a certain capacity. If it provides 10 megabits per second and you use that connection fully for sixty seconds, you would have downloaded (or uploaded, for that matter) 600 megabits, the equivalent of 15–25 songs on Spotify or SoundCloud (assuming 3–5 megabytes per song). The fantastic thing about digital information is that all bits are the same. It doesn’t matter whether you accessed Wikipedia or looked at pictures of kittens: you’ve paid for the bandwidth, and you should be free to use it to access whatever parts of human knowledge you want. 当你购买互联网接入时，你为一定容量的连接付费。如果它提供每秒10兆比特，你完全使用该连接60秒，你将下载（或上传，为此）600兆比特，相当于Spotify或SoundCloud上的15-25首歌曲（假设每首歌曲3-5兆比特）。数字信息的奇妙之处在于，所有比特都是一样的。你是访问维基百科还是看小猫的图片并不重要：你已经为带宽付费，你应该可以自由地使用它来访问你想要的人类知识的任何部分。 That principle, however, doesn’t maximize profit for the ISP. In order to do that, they seek to discriminate between different types of information, based on consumer demand and the supplier’s ability to pay. First they install equipment that lets them identify bits based on their origin. Then they go to a company like YouTube or Netflix and ask them to pay to have their traffic ’prioritized’ relative to traffic from other sources. Another form of manipulation that is common among wireless providers is so-called zero-rating, where some services pay to be excluded from monthly bandwidth caps. If permitted, ISPs will go a step further: in early 2017, the US Senate voted to allow them to sell customer data, including browsing history, without customer consent (Wenger, 2017b). 然而，这一原则并不能使互联网公司的利润最大化。为了做到这一点，他们试图根据消费者的需求和供应商的支付能力，对不同类型的信息进行区分。首先，他们安装设备，让他们根据其来源来识别比特。然后，他们去找YouTube或Netflix这样的公司，要求他们付费，让他们的流量相对于其他来源的流量 \"优先 \"使用。另一种常见于无线供应商的操纵形式是所谓的零费率，即一些服务付费以排除在每月带宽上限之外。如果被允许，互联网服务供应商将更进一步：2017年初，美国参议院投票允许他们在未经客户同意的情况下出售客户数据，包括浏览历史（Wenger, 2017b）。 The regulatory solution to this problem is blandly referred to as ‘net neutrality’, but what is at stake here is informational freedom itself. Our access to human knowledge should not be skewed by our ISPs’ financial incentives. We might consider switching to another ISP that provides neutral access, but in most geographic areas, especially in the United States, there is no competitive market for broadband Internet access. ISPs either have outright monopolies (often granted by regulators) or operate in small oligopolies. For instance, in the part of New York City where I live, there is just one broadband ISP. 对这个问题的监管解决方案被平淡地称为 \"网络中立\"，但这里的关键是信息自由本身。我们对人类知识的获取不应该被我们的互联网服务供应商的财务激励所歪曲。我们可能会考虑换成另一个提供中立访问的ISP，但在大多数地理区域，特别是在美国，宽带互联网接入没有竞争性市场。互联网服务供应商要么拥有彻底的垄断权（通常由监管机构授予），要么在小规模的寡头垄断中运营。例如，在我居住的纽约市部分地区，只有一家宽带ISP。 Over time, technological advances such as wireless broadband may make the market more competitive, but until then we need regulation to avoid ISPs limiting our informational freedom. This concern is shared by people all over the world: in 2016, India objected to a plan by Facebook to provide subsidized Internet access that would have given priority to their own services, and outlawed ‘zero rating’ altogether (Vincent, 2016). 随着时间的推移，无线宽带等技术进步可能会使市场更具竞争力，但在此之前，我们需要监管，以避免互联网服务提供商限制我们的信息自由。世界各地的人们都有这种担忧：2016年，印度反对Facebook提供补贴互联网接入的计划，该计划将优先考虑他们自己的服务，并完全取缔了 \"零评级\"（文森特，2016）。 Bots for All of Us 为我们所有人而设计的聊天机器人 Once you have access to the Internet, you need software to connect to its many information sources. When Tim Berners-Lee first invented the World Wide Web in 1989, he specified an open protocol, the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), that anyone could use both to make information available and to access it (\"Tim Berners-Lee,\" n.d.). In doing this, Berners-Lee enabled anyone to build software, so-called Web servers and browsers that would be compatible with this protocol. Many people did, including Marc Andreessen with Netscape, and many web servers and browsers were available as open-source or for free. 一旦你能进入互联网，你就需要软件来连接到它的许多信息源。当蒂姆-伯纳斯-李在1989年首次发明万维网时，他指定了一个开放的协议，即超文本传输协议（HTTP），任何人都可以用它来提供信息和访问信息（\"Tim Berners-Lee,\" n.d.）。在这样做的时候，伯纳斯-李使任何人都能建立软件，即所谓的网络服务器和浏览器，与这个协议兼容。许多人这样做了，包括Marc Andreessen和Netscape，许多网络服务器和浏览器都是开源的或免费的。 The combination of an open protocol and free software meant permissionless publishing and complete user control. If you wanted to add a page to the Web, you could just download a Web server, run it on a computer connected to the Internet and add content in the Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) format. Not surprisingly, the amount of content on the Web proliferated rapidly. Want to post a picture of your cat? Upload it to your Web server. Want to write something about the latest progress on your research project? There was no need to convince an academic publisher of its merits—you could just put up a web page. 开放协议和自由软件的结合意味着无权限的发布和完全的用户控制。如果你想在网上添加一个页面，你只需下载一个网络服务器，在一台连接到互联网的计算机上运行，并以超文本标记语言（HTML）的格式添加内容。毫不奇怪，网络上的内容数量迅速激增。想发布一张你的猫的照片吗？把它上传到你的网络服务器。想写一些关于你的研究项目的最新进展吗？没有必要说服学术出版商相信它的价值--你可以直接放上一个网页。 People accessing the Web benefited from their ability to completely control their own web browser. In fact, in the Hypertext Transfer Protocol, the web browser is referred to as a ‘user agent’ that accesses the Web on behalf of the user. Want to see the raw HTML as delivered by the server? Right click on your screen and use ‘View Page Source’. Want to see only text? Instruct your user agent to turn off all images. Want to fill out a web form but keep a copy of what you are submitting for yourself? Create a script to have your browser save all form submissions locally. 访问网络的人得益于他们能够完全控制自己的网络浏览器。事实上，在超文本传输协议中，网络浏览器被称为 \"用户代理\"，代表用户访问网络。想看看服务器交付的原始HTML吗？在你的屏幕上点击右键，使用 \"查看页面源代码\"。想只看文本吗？指示你的用户代理关闭所有图像。想填写一个网络表格，但要为自己保留一份提交内容的副本？创建一个脚本，让你的浏览器在本地保存所有提交的表格。 Over time, the platforms that have increasingly dominated the Web have interfered with some of the freedom and autonomy enjoyed by early users. I went on Facebook recently to find a note I posted some time ago on a friend’s wall. But it turns out that you can’t search through all the wall posts you have written: instead you have to scroll backwards in time for each friend, trying to remember when you posted what where. Facebook has all the data, but they’ve decided not to make it searchable. Whether or not you attribute this to intentional misconduct on their part: my point is that you experience Facebook the way they want you to experience it. If you don’t like how Facebook’s algorithms prioritize your friends’ posts in your newsfeed, tough luck. 随着时间的推移，越来越主导Web的平台干涉了早期用户所享有的某些自由和自治权。最近，我登陆Facebook想找到我一段时间前在朋友的墙上发布的一条消息。但结果是，你无法搜索所有你写过的墙上帖子：相反，你必须为每个朋友向后滚动时间线，试图记住你在何时何地发布了什么。Facebook拥有所有这些数据，但他们决定不让它们可搜索。无论你是否将这归因于他们故意的不端行为，我的观点是，你体验Facebook的方式是他们想让你体验的。如果你不喜欢Facebook算法在你的新闻推送中优先考虑你的朋友的帖子，那就太糟了。 Imagine what would happen if everything you did on Facebook was mediated by a software program—a ‘bot’—that you could control. You could instruct it to go through and automate the cumbersome steps that Facebook lays out for finding old wall posts. Even better, if you had been using this bot all along, it could have kept your own archive of wall posts in your own data store and you could simply instruct it to search your archive. If we all used bots to interact with Facebook and didn’t like how our newsfeed was prioritized, we could ask our friends to instruct their bots to send us status updates directly, so that we could form our own feeds. This was entirely possible on the Web because of the open protocol, but it is not possible in a world of proprietary and closed apps on smartphones. 想象一下，如果你在Facebook上所做的一切都由一个你可以控制的软件程序--\"机器人\"--来调解，会发生什么。你可以指示它通过并自动完成Facebook为寻找旧墙报所规定的繁琐步骤。更妙的是，如果你一直在使用这个机器人，它可以在你自己的数据存储中保存你自己的墙报档案，你可以简单地指示它搜索你的档案。如果我们都使用机器人与Facebook互动，并且不喜欢我们的新闻提要的优先次序，我们可以要求我们的朋友指示他们的机器人直接向我们发送状态更新，这样我们就可以形成自己的提要。这在网络上是完全可能的，因为有开放的协议，但在智能手机上的专有和封闭的应用程序的世界里，这是不可能的。 Although this example might sound trivial, bots have profound implications in a networked world. Consider the on-demand car services provided by companies such as Uber and Lyft. As drivers for these services know, each of them provides a separate app for them to use. You can try to run both apps on one phone or you can even have two phones, as some drivers do, but the closed nature of the apps means that you cannot use your phone’s computing power to evaluate competing offers. If you had access to bots that could interact with the networks on your behalf, you could simultaneously participate in these various marketplaces and play one off against the other. 虽然这个例子听起来微不足道，但机器人在网络世界中有着深远的影响。考虑一下由Uber和Lyft等公司提供的按需用车服务。正如这些服务的司机所知，他们每个人都提供一个单独的应用程序供他们使用。你可以尝试在一部手机上运行这两个应用程序，或者你甚至可以拥有两部手机，正如一些司机所做的那样，但应用程序的封闭性意味着你无法使用手机的计算能力来评估竞争的报价。如果你有机会接触到可以代表你与网络互动的机器人，你就可以同时参与这些不同的市场，并在其中进行对抗。 Using a bot, you could set your own criteria for which rides you want to accept, including whether a commission charged by a given network was below a certain threshold. The bot would then allow you to accept only rides that maximize the fare you receive. Ride-sharing companies would no longer be able to charge excessive commissions, since new networks could arise to undercut them. Similarly, as a passenger, using a bot would allow you to simultaneously evaluate the prices between different services and choose the one with the lowest price for a particular trip. 使用机器人，您可以设置自己的接单标准，包括某个网络收取的佣金是否低于某个阈值。然后，机器人将允许您仅接受最大化收入的乘车请求。由于新的网络公司可以打破原有公司过高的佣金收费模式，因此共享出行公司将不再能够收取过高的佣金。同样地，作为乘客，使用机器人将允许您同时评估不同服务之间的价格，并选择特定行程的最低价格。 We could also use bots as an alternative to antitrust regulation, in order to counter the power of technology giants like Google or Facebook without foregoing the benefits of their large networks. These companies derive much of their revenue from advertising, and consumers currently have no way of blocking ads on mobile devices. But what if users could control mobile apps to add ad-blocking functionality, just as they can with Web browsers? 我们还可以使用机器人作为反垄断监管的替代方案，以对抗谷歌或Facebook等技术巨头的力量，同时又不放弃其大型网络的好处。这些公司的大部分收入来自广告，而消费者目前没有办法阻止移动设备上的广告。但是，如果用户可以控制移动应用，增加广告屏蔽功能，就像他们可以控制网络浏览器一样，那会怎样？ Many people decry ad-blocking as an attack on journalism that dooms the independent Web, but that is a pessimistic view. In the early days of the Web, it was full of ad-free content published by individuals. When companies joined in, they brought their offline business models with them, including paid subscriptions and advertising. Along with the emergence of platforms such as Facebook and Twitter with strong network effects, this resulted in a centralization of the Web—content was increasingly either produced on a platform or moved behind a paywall. 许多人谴责广告屏蔽是对新闻业的攻击，使独立的网络走向灭亡，但这是一种悲观的看法。在网络的早期，它充满了由个人发布的无广告内容。当公司加入进来时，他们带来了他们的离线商业模式，包括付费订阅和广告。随着Facebook和Twitter等具有强大网络效应的平台的出现，这导致了网络的集中化--内容越来越多地被制作在一个平台上或被移到付费墙后面。 Ad-blocking is an assertion of power by the end user, which is a good thing in all respects. Just as a New York City judge found in 2015 that taxi companies have no special right to see their business model protected from ridesharing companies (Whitford, 2015), neither do ad-supported publishers. And while this might result in a downturn for publishers in the short term, in the long run it will mean more growth for content that is paid for more directly by end users (for example, through subscriptions or crowdfunding). 广告屏蔽是终端用户对权力的主张，这在各方面都是一件好事。正如纽约市的一位法官在2015年发现，出租车公司没有特殊权利看到他们的商业模式受到共享汽车公司的保护（Whitford, 2015），有广告支持的出版商也没有。虽然这在短期内可能会导致出版商的业绩下滑，但从长远来看，这意味着由最终用户更直接付费的内容（例如，通过订阅或众筹）会有更多的增长。 To curtail the centralizing power of network effects, we should shift power to the end users by allowing them to have user agents for mobile apps, just as we did with the Web. The reason users don’t wield the same power on mobile is that native apps relegate end users to interacting with services using our eyes, ears, brain and fingers. We cannot use the computing capabilities of our smartphones, which are as powerful as supercomputers were until quite recently, in order to interact with the apps on our behalf. The apps control us, instead of us controlling the apps. Like a Web browser, a mobile user agent could do things such as block ads, keep copies of responses to services and let users participate in multiple services simultaneously. The way to help end users is not to break up big tech companies, but to empower individuals to use code that executes on their behalf. 为了遏制网络效应的集中力量，我们应该把权力转移给终端用户，允许他们拥有移动应用的用户代理，就像我们对网络所做的那样。用户在移动端没有掌握同样的权力的原因是，原生应用程序使最终用户只能用我们的眼睛、耳朵、大脑和手指与服务进行互动。我们不能使用我们的智能手机的计算能力，这些能力在不久前还和超级计算机一样强大，以便代表我们与应用程序互动。应用程序控制我们，而不是我们控制应用程序。像网络浏览器一样，移动用户代理可以做一些事情，如阻止广告，保存对服务的反应的副本，让用户同时参与多个服务。帮助终端用户的方法不是拆散大型科技公司，而是授权个人使用代表他们执行的代码。 What would it take to make this a reality? One approach would be to require companies like Uber, Google and Facebook to expose their functionality, not just through apps and websites, but also through so-called Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). An API is what a bot uses to carry out operations, such as posting a status update on a user’s behalf. Companies such as Facebook and Twitter have them, but they tend to have limited capabilities. Also, companies have the right to shut down bots, even when a user has authorized them to act on their behalf. 如何才能使之成为现实？一种方法是要求Uber、谷歌和Facebook等公司不仅通过应用程序和网站，而且通过所谓的应用程序接口（API）来公开其功能。API是机器人用来进行操作的，比如代表用户发布状态更新。Facebook和Twitter等公司都有，但它们的能力往往有限。此外，公司有权关闭机器人，即使是在用户授权他们代表他们行事的情况下。 Why can’t I simply write code that interfaces with Facebook on my behalf? After all, Facebook’s app itself uses an API to talk to the Facebook servers. But in order to do that I would have to hack the Facebook app to figure out what the API calls are, and how to authenticate myself to them. Unfortunately, in the US there are three separate laws that make those steps illegal. The first is the anti-circumvention provision of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA). The second is the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA). And the third is the legal construction that by clicking ‘I accept’ on an End User License Agreement (EULA) or a set of Terms of Service (TOS), I am legally bound to respect whatever restrictions Facebook decides to impose. The last of these three is a civil matter, but criminal convictions under the first two laws carry mandatory prison sentences. 为什么我不能简单地编写代码，代表我与Facebook对接？毕竟，Facebook的应用程序本身使用API来与Facebook的服务器对话。但是，为了做到这一点，我必须入侵Facebook应用程序，找出API调用的内容，以及如何对其进行验证。不幸的是，在美国，有三条独立的法律使这些步骤成为非法。第一条是《数字千年版权法》（DMCA）的反规避条款。第二条是《计算机欺诈和滥用法》（CFAA）。第三是法律结构，即通过点击最终用户许可协议（EULA）或一套服务条款（TOS）上的 \"我接受\"，我在法律上必须尊重Facebook决定施加的任何限制。这三条中的最后一条是民事问题，但根据前两条法律进行的刑事定罪会被强制判处监禁。 If we were willing to remove these three legal obstacles, hacking an app to give programmatic access to systems would be possible. People might argue that those provisions were created to solve important problems, but that is not entirely clear. The anti-circumvention provisions of the DMCA was put in place to allow the creation of digital rights management systems for copyright enforcement. What you think of this depends on what you think about copyright, a subject we will look at in the next section. 如果我们愿意消除这三个法律障碍，黑掉一个应用程序来给系统提供程序化的访问就有可能。人们可能会说，这些条款是为了解决重要问题而设立的，但这并不完全清楚。DMCA的反规避条款是为了允许建立数字版权管理系统来执行版权。你对这一点的看法取决于你对版权的看法，我们将在下一节探讨这个问题。 The scope of the CFAA could be substantially decreased without limiting its potential for prosecuting fraud and abuse, and the same goes for restrictions on usage a company might impose via a license agreement or a terms of service. If I only take actions that are also available inside the company’s app but happen to take them via a program of my own choice, why should that constitute a violation? CFAA的范围可以大幅缩小，但不会限制其起诉欺诈和滥用的潜力，公司可能通过许可协议或服务条款施加的使用限制也是如此。如果我只采取了公司应用程序内也有的行动，但碰巧通过我自己选择的程序采取了这些行动，为什么要构成违规？ But, you might object, don’t companies need to protect the cryptographic keys that they use to encrypt communications? Aren’t ’botnets’ behind those infamous distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, where vast networks of computers flood a service with so many requests that no one can access it? It’s true that there are a lot of compromised machines in the world that are used for nefarious purposes, including set-top boxes and home routers. But that only demonstrates how ineffective the existing laws are at stopping illegal bots. As a result, companies have developed the technological infrastructure to deal with them. 但是，你可能会反对，难道公司不需要保护他们用来加密通信的密码钥匙吗？那些臭名昭著的分布式拒绝服务（DDoS）攻击的背后不就是 \"僵尸网络 \"吗？诚然，世界上有很多被破坏的机器被用于邪恶的目的，包括机顶盒和家用路由器。但这只能说明现有法律在阻止非法机器人方面是多么的无效。因此，公司已经开发了技术基础设施来处理它们。 How would we prevent people from using bots that turn out to be malicious code? For one, open-source code would allow people to inspect it to make sure it does what it claims. However, open source is not the only answer. Once people can legally be represented by bots, many markets currently dominated by large companies will face competition from smaller startups that will build, operate and maintain these bots on behalf of their end users. These companies will compete in part on establishing and maintaining a trust relationship with their customers, much like an insurance broker represents a customer in relationship with multiple insurance carriers. 我们将如何防止人们使用变成恶意代码的机器人？首先，开放源代码将允许人们检查它，以确保它做它所声称的事情。然而，开放源代码并不是唯一的答案。一旦人们可以合法地由机器人代表，许多目前由大公司主导的市场将面临来自小型创业公司的竞争，这些公司将代表他们的最终用户建立、运营和维护这些机器人。这些公司的竞争部分在于建立和维护与客户的信任关系，就像保险经纪人代表客户与多家保险公司的关系一样。 Legalizing representation by bots would put pressure on the revenues of the currently dominant companies. We might worry that they would respond by slowing their investment in infrastructure, but there are contravening forces as more money will be invested in competitors. For example Uber’s ‘take rate’ (the percentage of the money paid for rides that they keep) is 25 percent. If competition forced that rate down to 5 percent, Uber’s value might fall from $90 billion to$10 billion, but that is still a huge figure, and plenty of capital would be available for investing in competitive companies that can achieve that kind of outcome. 使机器人代理合法化将给目前占主导地位的公司的收入带来压力。我们可能会担心他们会通过放缓对基础设施的投资来应对，但也有相反的力量，因为更多的钱会被投资到竞争对手身上。例如，Uber的 \"取费率\"（他们保留的乘车费用的百分比）是25%。如果竞争迫使该比率下降到5%，那么Uber的价值可能会从900亿美元下降到100亿美元，但这仍然是一个巨大的数字，大量的资本将可用于投资能够实现这种结果的竞争公司。 That is not to say that there should not be limitations on bots. A bot representing me should have access to any functionality that I can access, but it should not be able to do things I can’t do, such as pretend to be another user or gain access to other people’s private posts. Companies can use technology to enforce such access limits for bots without relying on regulation that prevents bot representation in general. 这并不是说对机器人不应该有限制。代表我的机器人应该可以访问我可以访问的任何功能，但它不应该做我不能做的事情，例如假装成另一个用户或获得其他人的私人帖子。公司可以使用技术来执行对机器人的这种访问限制，而不依赖防止机器人代表的一般法规。 Even if you are now convinced of the merits of bots, you might be wondering how we will get there. The answer is that we can start very small. We could run an experiment in a city like New York, where the city’s municipal authorities control how on-demand transportation services operate. They might say, “If you want to operate here, you have to let drivers interact with your service through a program.” Given how big a market the city is, I’m confident these services would agree. Eventually we could mandate APIs for all Internet services that have more than some threshold number of users, including all the social networks and even the big search platforms, such as Google. 即使你现在对机器人的优点深信不疑，你可能想知道我们将如何达到目的。答案是，我们可以从非常小的地方开始。我们可以在纽约这样的城市进行实验，那里的市政当局控制着按需运输服务的运作方式。他们可能会说，\"如果你想在这里运营，你必须让司机通过一个程序与你的服务互动\"。鉴于城市是一个多么大的市场，我相信这些服务会同意。最终，我们可以为所有拥有超过一定门槛的用户的互联网服务规定API，包括所有的社交网络，甚至大型搜索平台，如谷歌。 To see that this is possible in principle, one need look no further than the UK’s Open Banking and the European Union’s Payment Services Directive, which require banks to offer an API for bank accounts (Manthorpe, 2018). This means that consumers can access third-party services, such as bill payment and insurance, by authorizing them to have access via the API instead of having to open a new account with a separate company. This dramatically lowers switching costs, and is making the market for financial services more competitive. The ACCESS Act, introduced by Senators Mark Warner and Josh Hawley in the US, was the first attempt to provide a similar concept for social media companies. While this particular effort hasn’t gone very far to date, it points to the possibility that bots could be used as an important alternative to Industrial Age antitrust regulation for shifting power back to end users. 要看到这在原则上是可行的，只需看看英国的开放银行和欧盟的支付服务指令，它们要求银行为银行账户提供一个API（Manthorpe，2018）。这意味着消费者可以通过API授权第三方服务，如账单支付和保险，而不是在单独的公司开立一个新账户。这大大降低了转换成本，并使金融服务市场的竞争更加激烈。美国参议员Mark Warner和Josh Hawley提出的ACCESS法案，是为社交媒体公司提供类似概念的首次尝试。虽然这项特殊的努力迄今还没有走得很远，但它指出了一种可能性，即机器人可以作为工业时代反托拉斯监管的一个重要替代方案，将权力重新转移到最终用户。 Limiting the Limits to Sharing and Creating 限制分享和创造的局限性 After we have fought against geographical and prioritization limits and have bots that represent us online, we will still face legal limits that restrict what we can create and share. I will first examine copyright and patent laws and suggest ways to reduce how much they limit the knowledge loop. Then I’ll turn to privacy laws. 在我们与地域和优先权的限制作斗争，并拥有代表我们在线的机器人之后，我们仍将面临法律的限制，限制我们可以创造和分享什么。我将首先研究版权和专利法，并建议如何减少它们对知识循环的限制程度。然后，我将转向隐私法。 Earlier I noted how expensive it was to make copies of books when they had to be copied one letter at a time. Eventually, the printing press and movable type were invented. Together, the two made reproducing information faster and cheaper. Even back then, governments and churches saw cheaper information dissemination as a threat to their authority. In England, the Licensing of the Press Act of 1662 made the government’s approval to operate a printing press a legal requirement (Nipps, 2014). This approval depended on agreeing to censor content that was critical of the government or that ran counter to the teachings of the Church of England. The origins of copyright laws (i.e., the legal right to make copies) are thus tied up with censorship. 早些时候我曾指出，当书籍必须一个字母一个字母地复制时，制作副本是多么昂贵。最终，印刷机和活字印刷术被发明出来。这两者结合在一起，使信息的复制变得更快、更便宜。即使在那时，政府和教会也将更便宜的信息传播视为对其权威的威胁。在英国，1662年的《新闻许可法》规定，政府批准经营印刷厂是一项法律要求（Nipps，2014）。这种批准取决于是否同意对批评政府或违背英国教会教义的内容进行审查。因此，版权法（即制作副本的合法权利）的起源与审查制度联系在一起。 Those who had the right to make copies, effectively had monopolies on the copyrighted content which proved to be economically attractive. Censorship, however, does not make for a popular argument to support an ongoing monopoly and so relatively quickly the argument for sustaining such an arrangement shifted to the suggestion that copyright was necessary as an inducement or incentive to produce content in the first place. The time and effort authors put into learning and writing not only made written works morally their property, the writer Daniel Defoe and others argued in the early 18th century: to motivate people to do those things, the production of “pyrated copies” had to be stopped (Deazley, 2004). While this argument sounds much more compelling than censorship, in practice, copyright was rarely held by the original creator even back then. Instead, the economic benefits of copyright have largely accrued to publishers, who for the most part acquire the copyright for a one-time payment to the author or songwriter. 那些拥有复制权的人，有效地垄断了受版权保护的内容，这证明在经济上是有吸引力的。然而，审查制度并不能成为支持持续垄断的流行论点，因此，维持这种安排的论点相对较快地转向了这样的建议：版权作为生产内容的诱因或激励是必要的。作家丹尼尔-笛福和其他人在18世纪初认为，作者为学习和写作所付出的时间和努力不仅使书面作品在道德上成为他们的财产：为了激励人们做这些事情，必须阻止 \"盗版 \"的生产（Deazley，2004）。虽然这个论点听起来比审查制度更有说服力，但实际上，即使在那时，版权也很少由原创作者持有。相反，版权的经济利益在很大程度上是由出版商获得的，他们在大多数情况下都是以一次性支付给作者或词曲作者的方式获得版权。 There is another problem with the incentive argument. It ignores a long history of prior content creation. Let’s take music as an example. Musical instruments were made as far back as 30,000 years ago, pre-dating the idea of copyright by many millennia. Even the earliest known encoding of a song, which marks music’s transition from information to knowledge, is around 3,400 years old (Andrews, 2018; Wulstan, 1971). Clearly then, people made and shared music long before copyright existed. In fact, the period during which it’s been possible for someone to earn a lot of money from making and then selling recorded music has been extraordinarily short. It started with the invention of the gramophone in the 1870s and peaked in 1999, the year that saw the biggest profits in the music industry, although the industry’s revenues have been gradually increasing again in recent years with the advent of streaming (Smith, 2020). 激励的说法还有一个问题。它忽略了之前内容创作的漫长历史。让我们以音乐为例。乐器早在3万年前就被制造出来了，比版权的概念早了好几千年。即使是已知的最早的歌曲编码，标志着音乐从信息到知识的过渡，也有大约3400年的历史（Andrews，2018；Wulstan，1971）。那么显然，在版权存在之前，人们早就制作和分享了音乐。事实上，人们有可能通过制作和销售录制的音乐赚取大量金钱的时期已经特别短了。它始于19世纪70年代留声机的发明，在1999年达到顶峰，这一年是音乐行业利润最大的一年，尽管近年来随着流媒体的出现，该行业的收入又逐渐增加（史密斯，2020）。 Before this short period, musicians made a living either from live performances or through patronage. If copyrighted music ceased to exist, musicians would still compose, perform and record music, and they would make money in the ways that they did prior to the rise of copyright. Indeed, as Steven Johnson found when he examined this issue, that is already happening, to some degree: “the decline in recorded-music revenue has been accompanied by an increase in revenues from live music... Recorded music, then, becomes a kind of marketing expense for the main event of live shows” (Johnson, 2015). Many musicians already choose to give away digital versions of their music, releasing tracks for free on SoundCloud or YouTube and making money from performing live (which during the COVID-19 pandemic had to shift to live streaming) or through crowdfunding methods such as Kickstarter and Patreon. 在这个短暂的时期之前，音乐家们要么通过现场表演，要么通过赞助来谋生。如果受版权保护的音乐不再存在，音乐家们仍然会创作、表演和录制音乐，他们会以版权兴起之前的方式赚钱。事实上，正如史蒂芬-约翰逊在研究这个问题时发现的那样，在某种程度上，这种情况已经在发生： \"录制音乐收入的下降伴随着现场音乐收入的增加......。那么，录制的音乐就成了现场演出的主要活动的一种营销费用\"（约翰逊，2015）。许多音乐家已经选择赠送他们音乐的数字版本，在SoundCloud或YouTube上免费发布曲目，并通过现场表演（在COVID-19大流行期间，不得不转向现场直播）或通过Kickstarter和Patreon等众筹方式赚钱。 Over time, copyright holders have strengthened their claims and extended their reach. For instance, with the passing of the US Copyright Act of 1976, the requirement to register a copyright was removed: if you created content, you automatically held copyright in it (U.S. Copyright Office, 2019). Then, in 1998, the US Copyright Term Extension Act extended the length of a term of copyright from 50 to 70 years beyond the life of the author. This became known as the “Mickey Mouse Protection Act” because Disney had lobbied for it: having built a profitable business based on protected content, they were mindful that a number of their copyrights were due to expire (Slaton, 1999). 随着时间的推移，版权持有人加强了他们的主张，扩大了他们的影响。例如，随着1976年《美国版权法》的通过，注册版权的要求被取消：如果你创造了内容，你就自动拥有了版权（美国版权局，2019年）。然后，1998年，美国《版权期限延长法》将版权期限从50年延长到70年，超过了作者的寿命。这被称为 \"米老鼠保护法\"，因为迪斯尼为此进行了游说：他们在受保护内容的基础上建立了一个有利可图的业务，他们意识到他们的一些版权即将到期（Slaton，1999）。 More recently, copyright lobbying has attempted to interfere with the publication of content on the Internet, through proposed legislation such as the Protect IP Act and the Stop Online Piracy Act, and language in the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), a trade deal that the United States did not ultimately join (after the United States withdrew, the language was removed). In these latest attempts at expansion, the conflict between copyright and the digital knowledge loop has become especially clear. Copyright limits what you can do with content that you have access to, essentially restricting you to consuming it. It dramatically curtails your ability to share content and to create other works that use some or all of it. Some of the more extreme examples include takedowns of videos from YouTube that used the song “Happy Birthday to You,” which was under copyright until just a few years ago. 最近，版权游说团体试图通过《保护知识产权法》和《制止在线盗版法》等拟议立法，以及美国最终没有加入的贸易协定《跨太平洋伙伴关系协定》（TPP）中的语言，来干预互联网上的内容发布（美国退出后，该语言被删除）。在这些最新的扩张尝试中，版权和数字知识圈之间的冲突已经变得特别明显。版权限制了你能对你能接触到的内容做什么，本质上限制了你对它的消费。它极大地限制了你分享内容和创作其他使用部分或全部内容的作品的能力。一些更极端的例子包括YouTube上使用 \"祝你生日快乐 \"这首歌的视频被撤下，而这首歌直到几年前还受到版权保护。 From a societal standpoint, it is never optimal to prevent someone from listening to or watching content that has already been created. Since the marginal cost of accessing a digital copy is zero, the world is better off if that person gets enjoyment from that content. And if that person becomes motivated to create some new inspiring content themselves, then the world is a lot better off. 从社会的角度来看，阻止某人收听或观看已经创造出来的内容，永远不是最佳选择。由于获取数字拷贝的边际成本为零，如果这个人从该内容中获得乐趣，世界会更好。如果这个人有动力自己创造一些新的鼓舞人心的内容，那么这个世界就会好很多。 Although the marginal cost for copying content is zero, you might wonder about the fixed and variable cost that goes into making it in the first place. If all content were to be free, then where would the money to produce it come from? Some degree of copyright is needed for content creation, especially for large-scale projects such as Hollywood movies or elaborate video games: it is likely that nobody would make them if, in the absence of copyright protection, they weren’t economically viable. Yet even for such big projects there should be constraints on enforcement. For instance, you shouldn’t be able to take down an entire service because it hosts a link to a pirated movie, as long as the link is promptly removed. More generally, I believe that copyright should be dramatically reduced in scope and made much more costly to obtain. The only automatic right accruing to content should be attribution. Reserving additional rights should require a registration fee, because you are asking for content to be restricted within the digital knowledge loop. 虽然复制内容的边际成本为零，但你可能会想知道首先用于制作内容的固定和可变成本。如果所有的内容都是免费的，那么制作内容的钱从哪里来？内容创作需要一定程度的版权，尤其是大型项目，如好莱坞电影或精心制作的视频游戏：如果没有版权保护，在经济上不可行，很可能没有人会制作这些项目。然而，即使是这样的大项目，也应该有执法方面的限制。例如，你不应该因为一个盗版电影的链接而关闭整个服务，只要该链接被迅速删除。更为普遍的是，我认为版权的范围应该大大缩小，获得版权的成本也应该大大增加。内容唯一自动产生的权利应该是归属权。保留其他权利应该需要注册费，因为你要求内容在数字知识圈内受到限制。 Imagine a situation where the only automatic right accruing to an intellectual work was attribution. Anyone wanting to copy or distribute your song would only have to credit you, something that would not inhibit any part of the knowledge loop. Attribution imposes no restrictions on making, accessing and distributing copies, or on creating or sharing derivative works. It can include referencing who wrote the lyrics, who composed the music, who played which instrument and so on. It can also include where you found this particular piece of music. This practice of attribution is already becoming popular for digital text and images using the Creative Commons License, or the MIT License in open source software development. 想象一下，在这种情况下，知识作品唯一自动产生的权利就是归属。任何想要复制或传播你的歌曲的人只需要归功于你，这不会妨碍知识循环的任何部分。署名对制作、获取和分发副本，或创造或分享衍生作品没有任何限制。它可以包括参考谁写的歌词、谁创作的音乐、谁演奏的乐器等等。它还可以包括你在哪里找到这个特定的音乐作品。这种归属的做法已经开始在数字文本和图像中流行，使用知识共享许可，或在开源软件开发中使用MIT许可。 If you don’t want other people to use your music without paying you, you are asking for its potential contributions to the knowledge loop to be restricted, thus reducing the benefits that the loop confers upon society. You should pay for that right, which not only represents a loss to society but will also be costly to enforce. The registration fee should be paid on a monthly or annual basis, and when you stop paying it, your work should revert to attribution-only status. 如果你不希望别人在不付钱给你的情况下使用你的音乐，你就是要求限制它对知识循环的潜在贡献，从而减少循环赋予社会的利益。你应该为这项权利付费，这不仅是社会的损失，而且执行起来也会很费劲。注册费应该按月或按年支付，当你停止支付时，你的作品应该恢复到只归属的状态。 In order to reserve rights, you should have to register your music with a registry, with some part of the copyright fee going towards maintaining the registry. Thanks to blockchains, which allow the operation of decentralized databases that are not owned or controlled by any one entity, there can be competing registries that access the same global database. The registries would be free to search, and registration would involve a check that you are not trying to register someone else’s work. The registries could be built in a way that anyone operating a music streaming service, such as Spotify or SoundCloud, could easily implement compliance to make sure they are not freely sharing music that has reserved rights. 为了保留权利，你应该在注册处注册你的音乐，版权费的一部分将用于维护注册处。由于区块链允许不为任何一个实体所拥有或控制的去中心化数据库的运行，可以有竞争性的注册机构访问同一个全球数据库。这些注册处可以自由搜索，注册时需要检查你是否试图注册别人的作品。登记处的建立方式可以使任何经营音乐流媒体服务的人，如Spotify或SoundCloud，可以很容易地实施合规性，以确保他们没有随意分享有保留权利的音乐。 It would even be possible to make the registration fee dependent on what rights you wanted to retain. For instance, your fee might be lower if you were prepared to allow non-commercial use of your music and to allow others to create derivative works, while it might increase significantly if you wanted all your rights reserved. Similar systems could be used for all types of content, including text, images and video. 甚至有可能使注册费取决于你想保留什么权利。例如，如果你准备允许对你的音乐进行非商业性使用并允许他人创作衍生作品，你的费用可能会低一些，而如果你想保留所有的权利，费用可能会大大增加。类似的系统可用于所有类型的内容，包括文本、图像和视频。 Critics might object that the system would impose a financial burden on creators, but it is important to remember that removing content from the knowledge loop imposes a cost on society. And enforcing this removal, by finding people who are infringing and penalizing them, incurs additional costs for society. For these reasons, asking creators to pay is fair, especially if their economic freedom is already assured by UBI. 批评者可能会反对，认为该系统会给创作者带来经济负担，但重要的是要记住，从知识圈中删除内容会给社会带来成本。而通过找到侵权者并对其进行处罚来执行这种删除，会给社会带来额外的成本。由于这些原因，要求创作者付费是公平的，特别是如果他们的经济自由已经得到了UBI的保证。 UBI also provides an answer to another argument that is frequently wielded in support of excessive copyright: employment by publishers. This argument is relatively weak, as the major music labels combined employ only a little over twenty thousand people (\"Sony Music,\" n.d.; “Universal Music Group,” n.d; “Warner Music Group,” n.d). On top of that, the existence of this employment to some degree reflects the societal cost of copyright. The owners, managers and employees of record labels are, for the most part, not the creators of the music. UBI还为另一个经常被用来支持过度版权的论点提供了答案：出版商的就业。这个论点相对较弱，因为主要的音乐公司加起来只雇用了两万多人（\"索尼音乐\"，注）；\"环球音乐集团\"，注；\"华纳音乐集团\"，注）。除此之外，这种就业的存在在某种程度上反映了版权的社会成本。唱片公司的老板、经理和雇员，在大多数情况下，并不是音乐的创造者。 Let me point out one more reason why a system of paid registration makes sense. No intellectual works are created in a vacuum. All authors have read books by other people, all musicians have listened to tons of music, and all filmmakers have watched countless movies. Much of what makes art so enjoyable is the existence of a vast body of art that it draws upon and can reference, whether explicitly or implicitly. We are all part of the knowledge loop that has existed for millennia. 让我再指出一个理由，说明付费注册制度是有意义的。没有任何智力作品是在真空中产生的。所有作者都读过别人的书，所有音乐家都听过大量的音乐，所有电影制作人都看过无数的电影。艺术之所以如此令人愉快，很大程度上是由于存在大量的艺术作品，它可以明确或隐含地借鉴和参考。我们都是已经存在了几千年的知识循环的一部分。 While copyright limits our ability to share knowledge, patents limit our ability to use knowledge to create something new. Just as having a copyright confers a monopoly on the reproduction of content, a patent confers a monopoly on its application. The rationale for patents is similar to the argument for copyright: the monopoly that is granted results in profits that are supposed to provide an incentive for people to invest in research and development. 版权限制了我们分享知识的能力，而专利则限制了我们利用知识创造新事物的能力。就像拥有版权就能垄断内容的复制一样，专利也能垄断内容的应用。专利的理由与版权的论点相似：授予的垄断导致了利润，应该为人们投资于研究和开发提供激励。 Here, as with copyright, this incentive argument should be viewed with suspicion. People invented things long before patents existed, and many have continued to invent without seeking them (Kinsella, 2013). Mathematics is a great example of the power of what is known as ‘intrinsic motivation’: the drive to do something for its own sake, and not because it will be financially rewarded. People who might have otherwise spent their time in a more lucrative way often dedicate years of their lives to work on a single mathematical problem (frequently without success). It is because of the intrinsic human drive to solve problems that the field has made extraordinary advances, entirely in the absence of patents, which thankfully were never extended to include mathematical formulas and proofs. As we will see momentarily, this problem solving drive can and has been successfully amplified through other means. 在这里，与版权一样，应该以怀疑的态度看待这种激励性的论点。早在专利存在之前，人们就已经发明了一些东西，而且很多人在没有寻求专利的情况下继续发明（Kinsella，2013）。数学是一个很好的例子，说明了所谓的 \"内在动机 \"的力量：为了自己的利益而做某件事，而不是因为会得到经济上的回报。那些本来可以用更有利可图的方式来打发时间的人，往往会将自己的生命奉献给一个数学问题（经常没有成功）。正是由于人类解决问题的内在动力，该领域取得了非凡的进步，完全是在没有专利的情况下，所幸的是，专利的范围从未扩大到包括数学公式和证明。我们马上就会看到，这种解决问题的动力可以而且已经通过其他方式成功地放大了。 The first patent system was established in Venice in the mid-fifteenth century, and Britain had a fairly well-established system by the seventeenth (“History of Patent Law,” 2020). That leaves thousands of years of invention, a time that saw such critical breakthroughs as the alphabet, movable type, the invention of the wheel and gears. This is to say nothing of those inventors who have chosen not to patent their inventions because they saw how that would impose a loss on society. A well-known example is Jonas Salk, who created the polio vaccine. Other important inventions that were never patented include X-rays, penicillin and the use of ether as an anesthetic (Boldrin & Levine, 2010). Since we know that limits on the use of knowledge impose a cost, we should ask what alternatives to patents exist which might stimulate innovation. 第一个专利制度于十五世纪中叶在威尼斯建立，英国在十七世纪就有了相当完善的制度（\"专利法的历史\"，2020）。这就留下了几千年的发明，在这个时期，出现了诸如字母、活字印刷、车轮和齿轮的发明等关键性的突破。更不用说那些选择不为其发明申请专利的发明家了，因为他们看到了这样做会给社会带来的损失。一个众所周知的例子是乔纳斯-索尔克，他创造了脊髓灰质炎疫苗。其他从未获得专利的重要发明包括X射线、青霉素和使用乙醚作为麻醉剂（Boldrin & Levine, 2010）。既然我们知道对知识使用的限制是有成本的，那么我们就应该问一问，除了专利，还有什么替代办法可以刺激创新。 Many people are motivated by wanting to solve a problem, whether it’s one they have themselves or something that impacts the world at large. With UBI, more of these people will be able to spend their time on inventing. We will also see more innovation because digital technologies are reducing the cost of inventing. One example of this is the company Science Exchange, which has created a marketplace for laboratory experiments. Say you have an idea that requires you to sequence a bunch of genes. The fastest gene sequencing available is from a company called Illumina, whose fastest machines used to cost more than $0.5 million to buy (Next Gen Seek, 2021). Through Science Exchange, however, you were able to access such a machine for less than $1,000 per use (“Illumina Next Generation Sequencing,” 2021). Furthermore, the next generation of sequencing machines is on the way, and these will further reduce the cost—technological deflation at work. 许多人的动机是想解决一个问题，无论是他们自己的问题还是影响整个世界的问题。有了UBI，这些人中更多的人将能够把时间花在发明上。我们还将看到更多的创新，因为数字技术正在减少发明的成本。这方面的一个例子是Science Exchange公司，它创建了一个实验室实验的市场。假设你有一个想法，需要你对一堆基因进行测序。目前最快的基因测序是来自一家名为Illumina的公司，其最快的机器过去需要花费超过50万美元来购买（Next Gen Seek, 2021）。然而，通过科学交易所，你能够以每次不到1000美元的价格获得这样一台机器（\"Illumina下一代测序\"，2021年）。此外，下一代测序机即将问世，这些机器将进一步减少成本-技术通缩的作用。 A lot of legislation has significantly inflated the cost of innovation. In particular, FDA rules around drug trials have made drug discovery prohibitively expensive, with the cost of bringing a drug to market exceeding $1 billion. While it is obviously important to protect patients, there are novel statistical techniques that would allow for smaller and faster trials (Berry et al., 2010). A small step was taken recently with the compassionate use of not-yet-approved drugs for fatally ill patients. Excessive medical damage claims have presented another barrier to innovation. As a result of these costs, many drugs are either not developed at all or are withdrawn from the market, despite their efficacy. For example, the vaccine against Lyme disease, Lymerix, is no longer available for humans following damage claims (Willyard, 2019). 很多立法大大抬高了创新的成本。特别是，美国食品和药物管理局围绕药物试验的规定使药物发现的成本过高，将一种药物推向市场的成本超过10亿美元。虽然保护病人显然很重要，但有一些新的统计技术可以使试验规模更小、速度更快（Berry等人，2010）。最近采取了一小步，对患有致命疾病的病人同情地使用尚未批准的药物。过度的医疗损害赔偿是创新的另一个障碍。由于这些费用，许多药物要么根本没有开发，要么从市场上撤下来，尽管它们有疗效。例如，预防莱姆病的疫苗Lymerix在损害索赔后不再用于人类（Willyard，2019）。 Patents are not the only way to incentivize innovation. Another historically successful strategy has been the offering of prizes. In 1714, Britain famously offered rewards to encourage a solution to the problem of determining a ship’s longitude at sea. Several people were awarded prizes for their designs of chronometers, lunar distance tables and other methods for determining longitude, including improvements to existing methods. Mathematics provides an interesting example of the effectiveness of prizes, which beyond money also provide recognition. In addition to the coveted Fields Medal for exceptional work by mathematicians under the age of 40, there are also the seven so-called Millennium Prize Problems, each with a $1 million reward (only one of which has been solved to date—and Grigori Perelman, the Russian mathematician who solved it, famously turned down the prize money opting only for the recognition). 专利并不是激励创新的唯一方式。历史上另一个成功的策略是提供奖品。1714年，英国为鼓励解决在海上确定船只的经度问题而提供了著名的奖励。一些人因为设计了天文钟、月球距离表和其他确定经度的方法（包括对现有方法的改进）而获得了奖励。数学界提供了一个有趣的例子，说明奖项的有效性，除了金钱之外，它还提供了认可。除了为40岁以下的数学家的杰出工作颁发令人垂涎的菲尔兹奖外，还有七个所谓的千年奖问题，每个问题都有100万美元的奖励（迄今为止，只有一个问题被解决了，解决这个问题的俄罗斯数学家格里戈里-佩雷尔曼拒绝了奖金，只选择了认可）。 At a time when we wish to accelerate the knowledge loop, we must shift the balance towards knowledge that can be used freely. The success of recent prize programs, such as the X Prizes, the DARPA Grand Challenge and NIST competitions, is promising, and the potential exists to crowdfund future prizes. Medical research should be a particular target for prizes, to help bring down the cost of healthcare. 在我们希望加速知识循环的时候，我们必须将平衡点转向可以自由使用的知识。最近的奖项计划，如X奖、DARPA大挑战和NIST竞赛的成功是有希望的，并且存在为未来的奖项进行众筹的潜力。医学研究应该是一个特别的奖励目标，以帮助降低医疗成本。 Though prizes can help accelerate the knowledge loop, that still leaves a lot of existing patents in place. I believe much can be done to make the system more functional, in particular by reducing the impact of so-called non-practicing entities (NPEs, commonly referred to as “patent trolls”). These companies have no operating business of their own, and exist solely for the purpose of litigating patents. They tend to sue not just a company but also that company’s customers, forcing a lot of companies into a quick settlement. The NPE then uses the settlement money to finance further lawsuits. Fortunately, a recent Supreme Court ruling placed limits on where patent lawsuits can be filed, which might curtail the activity of NPEs (Liptak, 2017). 虽然奖金可以帮助加速知识循环，但这仍然留下了大量的现有专利。我相信可以做很多事情来使这个系统更加实用，特别是通过减少所谓的非执业实体（NPEs，通常被称为 \"专利巨头\"）的影响。这些公司没有自己的经营业务，只为诉讼专利而存在。他们往往不仅起诉一家公司，还起诉该公司的客户，迫使很多公司快速和解。然后，NPE用和解金来资助进一步的诉讼。幸运的是，最高法院最近的一项裁决对可以提起专利诉讼的地方进行了限制，这可能会遏制NPE的活动（Liptak，2017）。 As a central step in patent reform, we must make it easier to invalidate existing patents, while at the same time making it more difficult to obtain new ones. We have seen some progress on both counts in the US, but there is still a long way to go. Large parts of what is currently patentable should be excluded from patentability, including university research that has received even small amounts of public funding. Universities have frequently delayed the publication of research in areas where they have hoped for patents that they could subsequently license out, a practice that has a damaging impact on the knowledge loop. 作为专利改革的核心步骤，我们必须使现有专利更容易无效，同时使获得新专利更加困难。在美国，我们已经在这两方面取得了一些进展，但仍有很长的路要走。目前可申请专利的大部分内容应被排除在专利之外，包括接受过哪怕是少量公共资金的大学研究。大学经常推迟发表他们希望获得专利的领域的研究，并随后将其许可出去，这种做法对知识循环产生了破坏性影响。 We have also gone astray in our celebration of patents as a measure of technological progress, when we should instead treat them at best as a necessary evil. Ideally, we would roll back the reach of existing patents and raise the bar for new ones, while also inducing as much unencumbered innovation as possible through prizes and social recognition. 我们在庆祝专利作为技术进步的衡量标准时也误入歧途，而我们最多只能将其视为一种必要的罪恶。理想情况下，我们会缩小现有专利的范围，提高新专利的门槛，同时通过奖励和社会认可，尽可能多地诱导不受约束的创新。 Getting Over Privacy 摆脱隐私 Copyrights and patents aren’t the only legal limitations that slow down the digital knowledge loop. We’re also actively creating new restrictions in the form of well-intentioned privacy regulations. Not only do these measures restrict informational freedom, but as I will argue below, in the long run privacy is fundamentally incompatible with technological progress. Instead of clinging to our current conception of privacy, we therefore need to understand how to be free in a world where information is widely shared. Privacy has been a strategy for achieving and protecting freedom. To get over this idea while staying free, we need to expand economic, informational and psychological freedom. 版权和专利并不是拖累数字知识循环的唯一法律限制。我们也在积极地以善意的隐私条例的形式创造新的限制。这些措施不仅限制了信息自由，而且正如我将在下面论证的那样，从长远来看，隐私从根本上是与技术进步不相容的。因此，我们不应固守目前的隐私概念，而是需要了解如何在一个信息广泛共享的世界里获得自由。隐私一直是实现和保护自由的一种策略。为了克服这种想法，同时保持自由，我们需要扩大经济、信息和心灵自由。 Before I expand on this position, let me first note that countries and individuals already take dramatically different approaches to the privacy of certain types of information. For example, for many years Sweden and Finland have published everyone’s tax return, and some people, including the Chief Information Officer and Dean for Technology at Harvard Medical School, have published their entire medical history on the Internet (Doyle & Scrutton, 2016; Zorabedian, 2015). This shows that under certain conditions it is eminently possible to publicly share exactly the type of information that some insist must absolutely remain private. As we will see, such sharing turns out not only to be possible but also extremely useful. 在我阐述这一立场之前，请允许我首先指出，国家和个人已经对某些类型的信息的隐私采取了截然不同的方法。例如，多年来，瑞典和芬兰公布了每个人的纳税申报单，有些人，包括哈佛医学院的首席信息官和技术院长，在互联网上公布了他们的全部医疗史（Doyle & Scrutton, 2016; Zorabedian, 2015）。这表明，在某些条件下，完全有可能公开分享一些人坚持必须绝对保持隐私的信息类型。正如我们将看到的，这种共享不仅是可能的，而且是非常有用的。 To better understand this perspective, compare the costs and benefits of keeping information private with the costs and benefits of sharing it widely. Digital technology is dramatically shifting this tradeoff in favor of sharing. Take a radiology image, for example. Analog X-ray technology produced an image on a physical film that had to be developed, and could only be examined by holding it up against a backlight. If you wanted to protect the information on it, you would put it in a file and lock it in a drawer. If you wanted a second opinion, you had to have the file sent to another doctor by mail. That process was costly, time-consuming and prone to errors. The upside of analog X-rays was the ease of keeping the information secret; the downside was the difficulty of putting it to use. 为了更好地理解这一观点，请比较保持信息隐私的成本和收益与广泛分享信息的成本和收益。数字技术正在极大地改变这种有利于共享的权衡。以放射学图像为例。模拟X射线技术在物理胶片上产生的图像必须被冲洗，并且只能通过将其放在背光下检查。如果你想保护上面的信息，你会把它放在一个文件里并锁在抽屉里。如果你想获得第二种意见，你必须把文件邮寄给另一位医生。这个过程成本高，耗时长，而且容易出错。模拟X射线的优点是容易保持信息的机密性；缺点是难以将其投入使用。 Now compare analog X-rays to digital X-rays. You can instantly walk out of your doctor’s office with a copy of the digital image on a thumb drive or have it emailed to you, put in a Dropbox or shared in some other way via the Internet. Thanks to this technology, you can now get a near-instant second opinion. And if everyone you contacted was stumped, you could post the image on the Internet for everyone to see. A doctor, or a patient, or simply an astute observer, somewhere in the world may have seen something similar before, even if it is incredibly rare. This has happened repeatedly via Figure 1, a company that provides an image sharing network for medical professionals. 现在将模拟X射线与数字X射线相比较。你可以立即带着优盘上的数字图像副本走出你的医生办公室，或者把它通过电子邮件发给你，放在Dropbox中，或者通过互联网以其他方式共享。由于这项技术，你现在可以得到一个近乎即时的第二意见。如果你联系的每个人都被难住了，你可以把图像发布在互联网上，让大家都看到。世界上某个地方的医生或病人，或者仅仅是一个精明的观察者，可能曾经看到过类似的东西，即使它是非常罕见的。这种情况已经通过图1多次发生，图1是一家为医疗专业人士提供图像共享网络的公司。 But this power comes at a price: protecting your digital X-ray image from others who might wish to see it is virtually impossible. Every doctor who looks at the image could make a copy—for free, instantly and with perfect fidelity—and send it to someone else. And the same goes for others who might have access to the image, such as your insurance company. 但这种能力是有代价的：保护你的数字X射线图像不被其他可能希望看到它的人看到几乎是不可能的。每个看图像的医生都可以免费地、即时地、完美地复制一份图像，并将其发送给其他人。其他可能获得图像的人也是如此，例如你的保险公司。 Critics will make claims about how we can use encryption to prevent the unauthorized use of your image, but those claims come with important caveats, and they are dangerous if pursued to their ultimate conclusion. In summary, the upside of a digital X-ray image is how easy it makes it to get help; the downside is how hard it is to protect digital information. 批评者会提出关于我们如何使用加密来防止未经授权使用你的图像的说法，但这些说法都有重要的注意事项，如果追求其最终结论，它们是危险的。总之，数字X射线图像的优点是使它很容易得到帮助；缺点是保护数字信息有多难。 But the analysis doesn’t end there. The benefits of your digital X-ray image go beyond just you. Imagine a huge collection of digital X-ray images, all labeled with diagnoses. We might use computers to search through them and get machines to learn what to look for. And these systems, because of the magic of zero marginal cost, can eventually provide future diagnoses for free. This is exactly what we want to happen, but how rapidly we get there and who controls the results will depend on who has access to digital X-ray images. 但分析并没有结束。你的数字X射线图像的好处不仅仅是你。想象一下，一个巨大的数字X射线图像集合，所有这些图像都标有诊断。我们可能使用计算机来搜索它们，并让机器学习寻找什么。而这些系统，由于零边际成本的魔力，最终可以免费提供未来的诊断。这正是我们希望发生的，但我们多快能达到这一目标，以及谁能控制结果，将取决于谁能获得数字X光图像。 If we made all healthcare information public, we would dramatically accelerate innovation in diagnosing and treating diseases. At present, only well-funded pharma companies and a few university research projects are able to develop new medical insights and drugs, since only they have the money required to get sufficient numbers of patients to participate in research. Many scientists therefore wind up joining big pharma companies, so the results of their work are protected by patents. Even at universities, the research agenda tends to be tightly controlled, and access to information is seen as a competitive advantage. While I understand that we have a lot of work to do to create a world in which the sharing of health information is widely accepted and has limited downsides, this is what we should be aiming for. 如果我们将所有的医疗信息公开，我们将大大加快诊断和治疗疾病的创新。目前，只有资金雄厚的制药公司和少数大学的研究项目能够开发新的医学见解和药物，因为只有他们有足够的资金来获得足够数量的病人参与研究。因此，许多科学家最终加入了大型制药公司，因此他们的工作成果受到专利保护。即使在大学，研究议程也往往被严格控制，获取信息被视为一种竞争优势。虽然我知道我们还有很多工作要做，以创造一个健康信息共享被广泛接受且弊端有限的世界，但这是我们应该追求的目标。 You might wonder why I keep asserting that assuring privacy is impossible. After all, don’t we have encryption? Well, there are several problems that encryption can’t solve. The first is that the cryptographic keys used for encryption and decryption are just digital information themselves, so keeping them secure is another instance of the original problem. Even generating a key on your own machine offers limited protection, unless you are willing to risk that the data you’re protecting will be lost forever if you lose the key. As a result, most systems include some kind of cloud-based backup, making it possible that someone will access your data, either through technical interception or by tricking a human being to unwittingly participate in a security breach. If you want a sense of how hard this problem is, consider the millions of dollars in cryptocurrency that can no longer be accessed by people who lost their key or who had them taken over through some form of attack. The few cryptocurrency exchanges that have a decent track record have invested massively in security procedures, personnel screening and operational secrecy. 你可能想知道为什么我一直断言保证隐私是不可能的。毕竟，我们不是有加密技术吗？嗯，有几个问题是加密无法解决的。首先，用于加密和解密的加密密钥本身就是数字信息，所以保持它们的安全是原始问题的另一个实例。即使在你自己的机器上生成一个密钥，也只能提供有限的保护，除非你愿意冒风险，如果你丢失了密钥，你所保护的数据将永远丢失。因此，大多数系统包括某种基于云的备份，使得有人有可能访问你的数据，无论是通过技术拦截还是通过欺骗人不知不觉地参与到安全漏洞中。如果你想了解这个问题有多难，请考虑一下数百万美元的加密货币，这些货币已经无法被丢失密钥或通过某种形式的攻击被接管的人所访问。少数有良好记录的加密货币交易所已经在安全程序、人员筛选和操作保密方面进行了大量投资。 The second problem is known as ‘endpoint security’. The doctor you’re sending your X-ray to for a second opinion might have a program on their computer that can access anything shown on the screen. In order to view your X-ray, the doctor has to decrypt and display it, so this program will have access to the image. Avoiding such a scenario would require us to lock down all computing devices, but that would mean preventing end users from installing software on them. Furthermore, even a locked-down endpoint is still subject to the “analog hole”: someone could simply take a picture of the screen, which itself could then be shared. 第二个问题被称为 \"端点安全\"。你要把你的X光片寄给第二个意见的医生，他们的电脑上可能有一个程序，可以访问屏幕上显示的任何东西。为了查看你的X射线，医生必须解密并显示它，因此这个程序将可以访问图像。要避免这样的情况，就需要我们锁定所有的计算设备，但这意味着阻止终端用户在上面安装软件。此外，即使是被锁定的终端仍然受到 \"模拟漏洞 \"的影响：有人可以简单地拍下屏幕的照片，然后它本身就可以被分享。 Locked-down computing devices reduce informational freedom and constrict innovation, but they also pose a huge threat to the knowledge loop and democracy. Handing over control of what you can compute and who you can exchange information with would essentially amount to submitting to a dictatorial system. In mobile computation we’re already heading in this direction, partly on the pretext of a need to protect privacy. Apple uses this as an argument to explain why the only way to install apps on an iPhone is through the App Store, which they control. Imagine this type of regime extended to all computing devices, including your laptop and cloud-based servers, and you have one way in which privacy is incompatible with technological progress. We can either have strong privacy assurance or open general-purpose computing, but we can’t have both. 锁定的计算设备减少了信息自由，限制了创新，但它们也对知识圈和民主构成了巨大的威胁。交出对你可以计算的内容以及你可以与谁交换信息的控制权，本质上等于服从于一个独裁系统。在移动计算中，我们已经在朝这个方向发展，部分是以保护隐私的需要为借口。苹果公司用这个理由来解释为什么在iPhone上安装应用程序的唯一途径是通过他们控制的App Store。想象一下这种制度扩展到所有计算设备，包括你的笔记本电脑和基于云的服务器，你就会发现隐私与技术进步不相容的一种方式。我们可以拥有强大的隐私保障，也可以拥有开放的通用计算，但我们不能两者兼得。 Many people contend that there must be some way to preserve privacy and keep innovating, but I challenge anyone to present a coherent vision of the future where individuals control technology and privacy is meaningfully protected. Whenever you leave your house, you might be filmed, since every smartphone has a camera, and in the future we’ll see tiny cameras on tiny drones. Your gait identifies you almost as uniquely as your fingerprint, your face is probably somewhere on the Internet, and your car’s license plate is readable by any camera. You leave your DNA almost everywhere you go, and we will soon be able to sequence DNA at home for around $100. Should the government control all of these technologies? And if so, should penalties be enforced for using them to analyze someone else’s presence or movement? Many are tempted to reply yes to these questions, without thinking through the consequences of such legislation for innovation and for the relative power of the state versus citizens. For example, citizens recently used facial recognition technology to identify police officers who had removed IDs from their uniforms. Advocates of banning this technology are overly focused on surveillance and never seem to consider these kind of “sousveillance” use cases (from French “sous” which means below). 许多人争辩说，必须有一些方法来保护隐私和继续创新，但我挑战任何人提出一个连贯的未来愿景，即个人控制技术和隐私得到有意义的保护。每当你离开家时，你可能会被拍摄，因为每个智能手机都有一个摄像头，在未来，我们会看到小型无人机上的微型摄像头。你的步态几乎和你的指纹一样独特地识别你，你的脸可能在互联网上的某个地方，而你的车牌可以被任何相机读取。你几乎走到哪里都会留下你的DNA，而且我们很快就能在家里花100美元左右进行DNA排序。政府应该控制所有这些技术吗？如果是这样，是否应该对使用这些技术来分析他人的存在或行动进行处罚？许多人很想对这些问题回答 \"是\"，却没有考虑到这种立法对创新和国家对公民的相对权力的影响。例如，公民最近使用面部识别技术来识别那些从制服上取下身份证的警察。主张禁止这种技术的人过度关注监视，似乎从未考虑过这种 \"sousveillance \"的使用情况（来自法语 \"sous\"，意思是下面）。 There is an even more profound reason why privacy is incompatible with technological progress. Entropy is a fundamental property of the universe, which means it is easier to destroy than to create. It can take hours to build a sand castle that is destroyed by a single wave washing ashore. It takes two decades of care for a human to grow up and a single bullet to end their life. Because of this inherent asymmetry, technological progress increases our ability to destroy more quickly than our ability to create. Today, it still takes twenty years for a human to grow, and yet modern weapons can kill thousands and even millions of people in an instant. So as we make technological progress, we must eventually insist on less privacy in order to protect society. Imagine a future in which anyone can create a biological weapon in their basement laboratory—for example, an even more deadly version of the COVID-19 virus. After-the-crime law enforcement becomes meaningless in such a world. 还有一个更深刻的原因，即隐私与技术进步不相容。熵是宇宙的一个基本属性，这意味着破坏比创造更容易。建造一个沙堡可能需要几个小时，但被一个波浪冲上岸就毁了。一个人的成长需要20年的照顾，而一颗子弹就能结束他们的生命。由于这种固有的不对称性，技术进步使我们的破坏能力比我们的创造能力更快。今天，一个人的成长仍然需要20年，而现代武器却可以在瞬间杀死数千甚至数百万人。因此，随着我们的技术进步，我们最终必须坚持减少隐私，以保护社会。想象一下，在未来，任何人都可以在他们的地下室实验室里制造一种生物武器--例如，一种更加致命的COVID-19病毒版本。在这样的世界里，犯罪后的执法工作变得毫无意义。 If we can’t protect privacy without passing control of technology into the hands of a few, we should embrace a post-privacy world. We should work to protect people and their freedom, rather than data and privacy. We should allow more information to become public, while strengthening individual freedom. Much information is already disclosed through hacks and data breaches, and many people voluntarily share private information on blogs and social media (McCandless, 2020). The economic freedom generated by the introduction of UBI will play a key role here, because much of the fear of the disclosure of private information results from potential economic consequences. For instance, if you are worried that you might lose your job if your employer finds out that you wrote a blog post about your struggles with depression, you are much less likely to share, a situation that, repeated across many people, helps to keep the topic of depression a taboo. There are, of course, countries where the consequences of private information being leaked, such as sexual orientation or political organizing, can be deadly. To be able to achieve the kind of post-privacy world I envision here, democracy with humanist values is an essential precondition. 如果我们不能在不把技术控制权转到少数人手中的情况下保护隐私，我们应该接受一个后隐私世界。我们应该努力保护人和他们的自由，而不是数据和隐私。我们应该允许更多信息公开，同时加强个人自由。许多信息已经通过黑客和数据泄露被披露，许多人自愿在博客和社交媒体上分享私人信息（McCandless，2020）。引入UBI所产生的经济自由将在这里发挥关键作用，因为人们对私人信息披露的恐惧大多来自于潜在的经济后果。例如，如果你担心如果你的雇主发现你写了一篇关于你与抑郁症斗争的博文，你可能会失去工作，那么你就更不可能分享，这种情况在许多人身上重复出现，有助于使抑郁症的话题成为禁忌。当然，在有些国家，私人信息被泄露的后果，如性取向或政治组织，可能是致命的。为了能够实现我在这里设想的那种后隐私世界，具有人文主义价值观的民主是一个重要的前提条件。 If a post-privacy world seems impossible or terrifying, it is worth remembering that privacy is a modern, urban construct. Although the US Constitution protects certain specific rights, it does not recognize a generalized right to privacy. For thousands of years prior to the eighteenth century, most people had no concept directly corresponding to our modern notion of privacy. Many of the functions of everyday life used to take place much more openly than they do today. And privacy still varies greatly among cultures: for example, many Westerners are shocked when they first experience the openness of traditional Chinese public restrooms (Sasha, 2013). All over the world, people in small villages live with less privacy than is common in big cities. You can either regard the lack of privacy in village as oppressive, or you can see a close-knit community as a real benefit, for instance when your neighbor notices that you are sick because you haven’t left the house and offers to go shopping for you. 如果一个后隐私世界似乎是不可能的或可怕的，那么值得记住的是，隐私是一个现代的、城市的构造。尽管美国宪法保护某些特定的权利，但它并不承认普遍的隐私权。在十八世纪之前的几千年里，大多数人都没有直接对应于我们现代隐私概念的概念。日常生活中的许多功能曾经比今天更公开地进行。而且，不同文化之间的隐私仍有很大差异：例如，许多西方人第一次体验到中国传统公共厕所的开放性时，会感到震惊（Sasha，2013）。在世界各地，小村庄里的人生活的隐私比大城市里常见的要少。你可以把村子里缺乏隐私看作是压迫性的，也可以把紧密的社区看作是真正的好处，例如，当你的邻居注意到你生病了，因为你没有离开家，并主动为你去购物。 “But what about my bank account?” you might ask. “If my account number was public, wouldn’t it be easier for criminals to take my money?” This is why we need to construct systems such as Apple Pay and Android Pay that require additional authentication to authorize payments. Two-factor authentication systems will become much more common in the future, and we will increasingly rely on systems such as Sift, which assesses in real time the likelihood that a transaction is fraudulent. Finally, as the Bitcoin blockchain shows, it is possible to have a public ledger that anyone can inspect, as long as the transactions on it are protected by ‘private keys’ which allow only the owner of a Bitcoin address to initiate transactions. \"但我的银行账户怎么办？\"你可能会问。\"如果我的账户号码是公开的，犯罪分子不是更容易拿走我的钱吗？\" 这就是为什么我们需要构建像苹果支付和安卓支付这样的系统，需要额外的认证来授权支付。双因素认证系统在未来将变得更加普遍，我们将越来越依赖Sift这样的系统，它可以实时评估一笔交易是欺诈性的可能性。最后，正如比特币区块链所显示的，只要其上的交易受到 \"私钥 \"的保护，只允许比特币地址的所有者发起交易，就有可能拥有一个任何人都可以检查的公共账本。 Another area where people are nervous about privacy is health information. We worry, for instance, that employers or insurers will discriminate against us if they learn that we have a certain disease or condition. Here the economic freedom conferred by UBI would help protect us from destitution because of discrimination. Furthermore by tightening the labor market, UBI would also make it harder for employers to refuse to hire certain groups of people in the first place. We could also enact laws that require transparency from employers to more easily detect discrimination (note that transparency is often difficult to require today because it conflicts with privacy). 人们对隐私感到紧张的另一个领域是健康信息。例如，我们担心，如果雇主或保险公司得知我们有某种疾病或状况，会对我们进行歧视。在这里，UBI所赋予的经济自由将有助于保护我们不会因为歧视而陷入贫困。此外，通过收紧劳动力市场，UBI也将使雇主更难在第一时间拒绝雇用某些群体的人。我们还可以制定法律，要求雇主提高透明度，以便更容易地发现歧视（注意，今天的透明度往往很难要求，因为它与隐私相冲突）。 Observers such as Christopher Poole, the founder of the online message board 4Chan, have worried that in the absence of privacy, individuals wouldn’t be able to engage online as freely. Privacy, they think, helps people feel comfortable assuming multiple online identities that may depart dramatically from their “real life” selves. I think, in contrast, that by keeping our online selves separate, we pay a price in the form of anxiety, neurosis and other psychological ailments. It is healthier to be transparent than to hide behind veils of privacy. Emotional health derives from the integration of our different interests into an authentic multi-dimensional personality, rather than a fragmentation of the self. This view is supported by studies of how online self-presentation impacts mental health, where inauthentic presentations were associated with higher levels of anxiety and neurosis (Twomey & O’Reilly, 2017). 网上留言板4Chan的创始人克里斯托弗-普尔（Christopher Poole）等观察家担心，如果没有隐私，个人就无法在网上自由活动。他们认为，隐私有助于人们放心地承担多种网上身份，而这些身份可能与 \"现实生活 \"中的自己大相径庭。我认为，与此相反，如果把我们的网上自我分开，我们就会以焦虑、神经症和其他心理疾病的形式付出代价。透明比躲在隐私的面纱后面更健康。情感健康来自于将我们不同的兴趣整合成一个真实的多维人格，而不是自我的分裂。这一观点得到了关于网上自我介绍如何影响心理健康的研究的支持，不真实的介绍与较高的焦虑和神经症水平有关（Twomey & O'Reilly, 2017）。 Many who argue against a post-privacy approach point out that oppressive governments can use information against their citizens. Without a doubt, preserving democracy and the rule of law is essential if we want to achieve a high degree of informational freedom, and this is addressed explicitly in Part Five. Conversely, however, more public information makes dictatorial takeovers considerably harder. For instance, it is much clearer who is benefiting from political change if tax records are in the public domain. 许多反对后隐私方法的人指出，压迫性的政府可以利用信息来对付他们的公民。毫无疑问，如果我们想实现高度的信息自由，维护民主和法治是必不可少的，这一点将在第五部分明确讨论。然而，反过来说，更多的公共信息会使独裁者的接管变得更加困难。例如，如果税收记录在公共领域，那么谁从政治变革中获益就更清楚了。 "},"docs/Part_Four_Enhancing_Freedom/Psychological_Freedom.html":{"url":"docs/Part_Four_Enhancing_Freedom/Psychological_Freedom.html","title":"心灵自由","keywords":"","body":"心灵自由 Imagine you live in a society that has achieved economic and informational freedom. Would you make good use of those freedoms, or would your beliefs and fears hold you back from engaging in the knowledge loop? Or worse yet, would your attention be taken up by systems designed to capture it for someone else’s benefit? Would you feel free to pursue your own interests, or would your Industrial Age beliefs keep you trapped in the job loop? Would you have a strong sense of purpose, or would you feel adrift without a clear career path and a boss telling you what to do? Would you seek out new knowledge, or would you seek to confirm what you already believe? Would you feel free to create, or would you hold yourself back out of fear? And would you recognize when your attention is being manipulated? 想象一下，你生活在一个已经实现了经济和信息自由的社会。你会好好利用这些自由吗？还是你的信仰和恐惧会阻碍你参与知识的循环？或者更糟糕的是，你的注意力会不会被旨在为别人的利益而捕获的系统所占据？你会觉得可以自由地追求自己的兴趣，还是你在工业时代的信念会让你被困在工作圈里？你会有强烈的目标感，还是会在没有明确的职业道路和老板告诉你该做什么的情况下感到漂泊不定？你会寻求新的知识，还是会寻求确认你已经相信的东西？你会感到自由地创造，还是会因为恐惧而抑制自己？你会意识到你的注意力被操纵了吗？ While the previous sections on economic and informational freedom examined changes that require collective action, this section addresses individual action. We must free ourselves from our deeply engrained Industrial Age beliefs, and we can start on that path by developing some form of mindfulness practice. This, in my view, is essential to freely directing our attention in the Knowledge Age. 前面关于经济和信息自由的章节考察了需要集体行动的变化，而本节则涉及个人行动。我们必须把自己从根深蒂固的工业时代信仰中解放出来，我们可以通过发展某种形式的正念练习来开始这条道路。在我看来，这对于在信息时代自由地引导我们的注意力至关重要。 I should start by acknowledging the profound psychological dimension of the transition out of the Industrial Age. Social and economic disruption were making life stressful even before the Covid-19 pandemic. The unfolding climate crisis and the ongoing escalation of political and social tensions around the world are further causes for anxiety. To make matters worse, we have yet to learn to live healthily with new technology, and we obsessively check our smartphones during meetings, while driving, and before we go to sleep. This is taking an immense psychological toll, as increases in sleep disorders, suicide rates, drug overdoses and antisocial behaviors (e.g., bullying) show. 首先，我应该承认走出工业时代的过渡期所带来的深刻的心理影响。甚至在Covid-19大流行病之前，社会和经济的破坏就已经使生活变得紧张。正在发生的气候危机和世界各地持续升级的政治和社会紧张局势是造成焦虑的进一步原因。更糟糕的是，我们还没有学会与新技术一起健康地生活，我们在开会时、开车时和睡觉前痴迷地查看我们的智能手机。这正在造成巨大的心理损失，睡眠障碍、自杀率、药物过量和反社会行为（如欺凌）的增加都表明了这一点。 We need to go beyond that general insight about the population at large and look at what goes on in our own heads, but that requires time and effort because our brains are easily hijacked by emotional reactions that interfere with introspection and self-awareness. Can we overcome the anxieties that might prevent us from gaining, creating and sharing knowledge? Can we put down our phones, when they are designed to draw us in? It might seem like a monumental task, but humankind is uniquely adaptable. After all, we have navigated two prior transitions that required dramatic psychological change, first from the Forager Age to the Agrarian Age, and then to the Industrial Age. 我们需要超越这种对广大民众的一般洞察力，看看我们自己头脑中的情况，但这需要时间和努力，因为我们的大脑很容易被干扰内省和自我意识的情绪反应所劫持。我们能克服可能阻碍我们获得、创造和分享知识的焦虑吗？当手机被设计用来吸引我们的时候，我们能放下手机吗？这可能看起来是一项艰巨的任务，但人类具有独特的适应能力。毕竟，我们已经经历了两次需要巨大心理变化的过渡，先是从觅食时代到农业时代，然后是工业时代。 We now understand why humans can adapt so well. As neuroscientists have discovered, our brains remain plastic even as we age, meaning that what and how we think can be changed. In fact, we can change it quite deliberately, with techniques such as conscious breathing, meditation and cognitive behavioral therapy (McClintock, 2020; “Cognitive Behavioral Therapy,” 2020). As a crude approximation, the brain can be thought of as consisting of two systems: one that instinctually produces emotions and snap judgments and one that allows for rational thought but requires effort (Kahneman, 2013). Mindfulness techniques allow us better access to our rational faculties by limiting the extent to which our instinctual reactions control our behavior. 我们现在明白了为什么人类可以适应得如此好。正如神经科学家所发现的那样，我们的大脑即使随着年龄的增长仍然具有可塑性，这意味着我们思考的内容和方式是可以改变的。事实上，我们可以通过有意识的呼吸、冥想和认知行为疗法等技术，相当刻意地改变它（麦克林托克，2020；\"认知行为疗法\"，2020）。作为一个粗略的近似，大脑可以被认为是由两个系统组成：一个是本能地产生情绪和快速判断，一个是允许理性思考但需要努力的系统（卡尼曼，2013）。正念技术通过限制本能反应对我们行为的控制程度，使我们能够更好地利用我们的理性能力。 The idiom “take a deep breath” captures this idea well: pause and reflect before acting. The larger concept of deliberately freeing the mind is found in both Eastern and Western traditions. The Stoic philosophers developed practices of thought to temper the emotions, such as imagining the loss of a possession repeatedly before it occurs. In Buddhism, meditation techniques help practitioners achieve similar psychological freedom. We now have neuroscience research that lets us begin to understand how these techniques work, showing that their persistence over time is not a matter of religious belief or superstition, but grounded in the physical reality of our brains (Yoon et al., 2019). 成语 \"深呼吸 \"很好地抓住了这个概念：在行动之前暂停和反思。东方和西方的传统中都有刻意解放思想的大概念。斯多葛派的哲学家们发展了思考的实践，以控制情绪，例如在发生之前反复想象失去财产的情景。在佛教中，冥想技术帮助修行者实现类似的心灵自由。我们现在有了神经科学的研究，让我们开始了解这些技巧是如何工作的，表明它们长期存在不是宗教信仰或迷信的问题，而是基于我们大脑的物理现实（Yoon等人，2019）。 We will now examine what we need to free ourselves from so that we can direct our attention to contributing to the knowledge loop and other Knowledge Age activities. 我们现在将研究我们需要把自己从*中解放出来，以便我们能够把注意力放在为知识圈和其他信息时代的活动作出贡献上。 Freedom from Wanting 免于匮乏的自由 The extraordinary success of capitalism has made us confused about work and consumption. Instead of seeing them as a means to an end, we now see them as sources of purpose in themselves. Working harder and consuming more allows the economy to grow, so that... we can work harder and consume more. Though this sounds crazy, it has become the default position. We went so far as to ingrain this view in religion, moving to a Protestant work ethic that encourages working harder and earning more (Skidelsky & Skidelsky, 2013). Similar changes have taken place throughout Asia, where other religions have undergone this transition, most prominently in the case of the “New Confucianism” as championed by Lee Kuan Yew, the founding Prime Minister of Singapore (Pezzutto, 2019). 资本主义的非凡成功使我们对工作和消费感到困惑。我们现在不再将它们视为达到目的的手段，而是将它们视为目的本身的来源。更努力的工作和更多的消费使经济增长，这样......我们可以更努力的工作和更多的消费。虽然这听起来很疯狂，但它已经成为默认的立场。我们甚至将这种观点根植于宗教中，转向鼓励更努力工作和赚取更多收入的新教工作伦理（Skidelsky & Skidelsky, 2013）。类似的变化也发生在整个亚洲，其他宗教也经历了这种转变，最突出的是新加坡开国总理李光耀倡导的 \"新儒家思想\"（Pezzutto，2019）。 Even worse, we frequently find ourselves trapped in what’s known as ‘positional consumption’, or “Keeping up with the Joneses.” This is where what matters to us are not the inherent benefits of the things we buy, but their relative prestige. If our neighbor buys a new car, we find ourselves wanting an even newer and more expensive model. Such behavior has emerged not just with respect to goods but also to services—think of the $1,000 haircut or the $595-per-person dinner at a Michelin-starred restaurant (Orlo Salon, n.d.; Cross, 2020). Of course, much of this confusion has been fueled by trillions of dollars of advertising spend aimed at convincing us to buy more, flooding us with imagery of how happy we’ll be if only we do. Between economic policy, advertising and religion, it is no wonder that many people are convinced that materialism is part of human nature. 更糟糕的是，我们经常发现自己陷入了所谓的 \"位置性消费\"，或 \"跟上琼斯\"。在这种情况下，对我们来说，重要的不是我们所购买的东西的内在好处，而是它们的相对声望。如果我们的邻居买了一辆新车，我们就会发现自己想买一辆更新、更贵的车型。这种行为不仅出现在商品方面，也出现在服务方面--想想1000美元的理发或米其林星级餐厅的595美元/人的晚餐（Orlo Salon, n.d.; Cross, 2020）。当然，这种混乱大部分是由数万亿美元的广告支出所助长的，这些广告旨在说服我们购买更多的东西，让我们充斥着如果我们这样做就会多么幸福的想象力。在经济政策、广告和宗教之间，难怪许多人相信物质主义是人类本性的一部分。 However, our addiction to consumption is exactly that—an addiction that exploits a mechanism in the brain. When you desire something, a new car for instance, your brain gets a dopamine hit based on your anticipated happiness, which makes you feel good. Once you get the car, you compare it to your prior expectations. If the car turns out to be less than you expected, your dopamine levels will decrease and this can cause extreme disappointment. If your expectations are met, your dopamine levels will stay constant. Only if your expectations are exceeded will you get another hit of dopamine. Now as you get used to having the new car your expectation adjusts and so quite quickly after the initial purchase you no longer receive any new dopamine from having a new car. The unfortunate result of all this is known as the ‘hedonic treadmill.’ When your brain grows accustomed to something like a car or an apartment, then recreating the same feeling of happiness as your original anticipation for the car or apartment now requires a faster car or a bigger apartment (Szalavitz, 2017). 然而，我们的消费成瘾正是如此--一种利用大脑中的机制的成瘾。当你渴望某样东西时，例如一辆新车，你的大脑会根据你预期的幸福感获得多巴胺的冲击，这让你感觉良好。一旦你得到这辆车，你会把它与你之前的期望值进行比较。如果汽车结果不如你的预期，你的多巴胺水平就会下降，这可能导致极度失望。如果你的期望得到满足，你的多巴胺水平将保持不变。只有当你的期望值被超出时，你才会得到另一次多巴胺的冲击。现在，当你习惯于拥有新车时，你的期望值就会调整，所以在最初购买后，你很快就不再从拥有新车中获得任何新的多巴胺。这一切的不幸结果被称为 \"享乐主义的跑步机\"。当你的大脑逐渐习惯于像汽车或公寓这样的东西时，那么重新创造与你最初对汽车或公寓的预期相同的幸福感现在需要更快的汽车或更大的公寓（Szalavitz, 2017）。 That same mechanism, however, can provide long-term motivation when the anticipation is aimed at creation or exploration instead of consumption. As an artist or scientist, you can forever seek out new subjects. As a traveler, you can forever seek out new destinations. Freedom from wanting—in the sense of the delusional belief that consumption as such will bring happiness or meaning—is possible if we recognize that we can point our brain away from consumption and towards other pursuits, many of which are part of the knowledge loop. Redirecting our reward mechanism re-establishes the difference between needs and wants. You need to eat, while you may want to eat at a Michelin-starred restaurant. You need to drink water, while you may want to drink an expensive wine. This is why UBI, as discussed earlier, focuses on meeting needs rather than wants. Once you are economically free to meet your needs and are freeing yourself from wanting, you can direct your attention to the knowledge loop. 然而，当期待的目的是创造或探索而不是消费时，同样的机制可以提供长期的动力。作为一个艺术家或科学家，你可以永远寻找新的主题。作为一个旅行者，你可以永远寻找新的目的地。如果我们认识到我们可以把我们的大脑从消费中引向其他追求，其中许多是知识循环的一部分，那么从欲望中解脱出来--即认为消费本身会带来幸福或意义的妄想--是可能的。重新引导我们的奖励机制重新确立了需求和欲望之间的区别。你需要吃饭，而你可能想在米其林星级餐厅吃饭。你需要喝水，而你可能想喝一种昂贵的葡萄酒。这就是为什么UBI，如前面所讨论的，侧重于满足需求而不是欲望。一旦你在经济上可以自由地满足你的需求，并且从欲望中解放出来，你就可以把注意力转移到知识圈上。 Suppose skiing is your passion and you want to keep seeking the perfect powder. How would a UBI let you focus your attention on it? On a UBI alone, you might not be able to afford an annual ski trip to the Swiss alps, but ski equipment is actually not expensive when you consider that it can last for many years and can be shared with others. And if you’re willing to hike up a mountain, you can ski as much as you want without buying a lift pass at an expensive resort. 假设滑雪是你的激情所在，你想继续寻求完美的滑雪场。一个UBI如何让你把注意力集中在它上面？仅仅依靠UBI，你可能无法负担每年去瑞士阿尔卑斯山滑雪的费用，但如果考虑到滑雪设备可以使用很多年，并且可以与他人分享，那么滑雪设备实际上并不昂贵。而且，如果你愿意徒步上山，你可以尽情地滑雪，而不需要在昂贵的度假村购买缆车票。 In this instance, psychological freedom means freeing yourself of assumptions that you might have about how to go skiing. It helps, of course, to remind yourself that many of these assumptions are formed by companies that have a commercial interest in portraying skiing that way. If you can learn to reframe it as an outdoor adventure and a chance to be in nature, it needn’t be expensive. A similar logic holds for any number of other activities. 在这个例子中，心灵自由意味着将自己从关于如何去滑雪的假设中解放出来。当然，提醒自己这些假设中有许多是由那些对滑雪有商业利益的公司形成的。如果你能学会把它重塑为一次户外探险和一个在大自然中的机会，它就不需要很昂贵。类似的逻辑也适用于任何数量的其他活动。 To free ourselves from wanting, we should remind ourselves of the difference between needs and wants, learn how our brain works and point our seeking away from consumption towards creative and experiential activities. For many of us, that means letting go of existing attachments to wants that we have developed over a long time. Finally, we should always cast a critical eye on the advertising we encounter, understanding that it perpetuates illusions about needs and wants and keeps us trapped in the job loop. 为了把自己从欲望中解放出来，我们应该提醒自己需要和欲望之间的区别，了解我们的大脑是如何工作的，并把我们的追求从消费指向创造性和体验性活动。对我们中的许多人来说，这意味着放下我们长期以来形成的对欲望的现有执着。最后，我们应该始终对我们遇到的广告投以批判的目光，理解它使关于需求和欲望的幻想永久化，并使我们陷于工作循环。 Freedom to Learn 自由学习 Young children ask dozens of questions a day, often annoying their parents who don’t have the time to answer. Humans are naturally curious, and it is this curiosity that has driven much of our progress (Shin & Kim, 2019). At the same time, our curiosity was not well-suited to the Industrial Age. If you employ people in a factory job that has them performing the same action all day every day, curiosity is not a desirable trait. The same goes for many modern service jobs, such as operating a cash register or delivering packages. 年幼的孩子每天要问几十个问题，常常惹恼了没有时间回答的父母。人类天生具有好奇心，正是这种好奇心推动了我们的大部分进步（Shin & Kim, 2019）。同时，我们的好奇心也不太适合工业时代的发展。如果你雇用人们从事工厂工作，让他们每天都在做同样的动作，那么好奇心就不是一个理想的特质。许多现代服务工作也是如此，如操作收银机或递送包裹。 The present-day educational system was built to support the job loop of the industrial economy, so it is not surprising that it tends to suppress rather than encourage curiosity (Gatto et al., 2017). While educators hardly ever identify “suppressing curiosity” as one of their goals, many of our educational practices do exactly that. For instance, forcing every eight-year-old to learn the same things in math, teaching for tests, and cuts to music and art classes all discourage curiosity. 当今的教育体系是为了支持工业经济的工作循环而建立的，所以它倾向于压制而不是鼓励好奇心也就不奇怪了（Gatto等人，2017）。虽然教育工作者几乎没有把 \"压制好奇心 \"作为他们的目标之一，但我们的许多教育实践正是这样做的。例如，强迫每个8岁的孩子学习相同的数学知识，为考试而教学，以及削减音乐和艺术课程，都会抑制好奇心。 A critical way that we undermine curiosity is by evaluating areas of knowledge according to whether we think they will help us get a “good job.” If your child expressed an interest in learning Swahili or wanting to play the mandolin, would you support that? Or would you say something like, “But how will you earn a living with that?” The latest iteration of this thinking is an enthusiasm for learning how to code in order to get high-paying job in tech. Here again, instead of encouraging curiosity about coding, either for its own sake or as a tool in science or art, we force it into the Industrial Age logic of the job loop. 我们破坏好奇心的一个重要方式是根据我们认为知识领域是否会帮助我们得到一份 \"好工作 \"来评估它们。如果你的孩子表示对学习斯瓦希里语或想弹曼陀林感兴趣，你会支持吗？或者你会说：\"但是你怎么靠这个谋生呢？\" 这种思维的最新迭代是对学习代码的热情，以便在技术领域获得高薪工作。在这里，我们没有鼓励对编码的好奇心，无论是为了它本身还是作为科学或艺术的工具，而是把它强行纳入工业时代的工作循环逻辑。 We need to free ourselves from this instrumental view of knowledge and embrace learning for its own sake. As we’ve already seen, UBI can go a long way in allaying fears that we won’t be able to support ourselves if we let our curiosity guide our learning. But will we have enough engineers and scientists in such a world? If anything, we’ll likely have more than we do under the current system. After all, forcing kids to study something is a surefire way to squelch their natural curiosity. 我们需要将自己从这种工具性的知识观中解放出来，并接受为了学习而学习。正如我们已经看到的，UBI可以在很大程度上减轻人们的担忧，即如果我们让好奇心引导我们的学习，我们将无法养活自己。但是，在这样一个世界里，我们会有足够的工程师和科学家吗？如果有的话，我们可能会比目前的制度下拥有更多。毕竟，强迫孩子们学习一些东西是压制他们自然好奇心的一个可靠方法。 The knowledge loop, accelerated by digital technology, brings to the fore other limits to learning that we must also overcome. The first of these is confirmation bias. As humans we find it easier to process information that confirms what we already believe to be true. We can access a huge amount of online content that confirms our pre-existing beliefs rather than learning something new. We risk becoming increasingly entrenched in these views, fracturing into groups with strong and self-reinforcing beliefs. This phenomenon becomes even more pronounced with the automatic personalization of many Internet systems, with ‘filter bubbles’ screening out conflicting information (Pariser, 2021). 由数字技术加速的知识循环，使我们必须克服的其他学习限制凸显出来。其中第一个是确认性偏见。作为人类，我们发现更容易处理那些证实我们已经相信是真的信息。我们可以访问大量的在线内容来证实我们已有的信念，而不是学习新的东西。我们有可能变得越来越固执于这些观点，分裂成具有强烈和自我强化的信念的群体。随着许多互联网系统的自动个性化，这种现象变得更加明显，\"过滤泡 \"将冲突的信息筛选出来（Pariser, 2021）。 Another barrier to learning is the human tendency to jump to conclusions on the basis of limited data. After a study suggested that smaller schools tended to produce better student performance than larger schools, educators began to create a lot of smaller schools, only for a subsequent study to find that a lot of smaller schools were also doing poorly. It turns out that the more students a school has, the more likely it is to approximate the overall distribution of students. A small school is therefore more likely to have students who perform predominantly well or poorly. 学习的另一个障碍是人类倾向于在有限的数据基础上跳出结论。在一项研究表明，规模较小的学校往往比规模较大的学校产生更好的学生成绩后，教育工作者开始创建大量的小型学校，只是在随后的研究中发现，许多小型学校也表现不佳。事实证明，一所学校的学生越多，就越有可能接近学生的整体分布。因此，一所小学校更有可能出现以表现好或表现差为主的学生。 Daniel Kahneman discusses such biases in his book Thinking, Fast and Slow. We rely on heuristics that result in confirmation bias and storytelling because many of the systems in the human brain are optimized for speed and effortlessness. These heuristics aren’t necessarily all bad as they can contribute to important ruin avoidance mechanisms (something which Kahneman ignores), but they served us better in a world with an analog knowledge loop, where more time existed for correcting mistakes. In today’s high-velocity digital knowledge loop, we must slow ourselves down or risk passing along incorrect stories. A recent study showed that false stories spread online many times more quickly than true ones (Vosoughi et al., 2018). 丹尼尔-卡尼曼在他的《思考，快与慢》一书中讨论了这种偏见。我们依赖启发式方法，导致确认性偏见和讲故事，因为人类大脑中的许多系统是为速度和不费力而优化的。这些启发式方法不一定都是坏事，因为它们可以促进重要的避免毁坏的机制（卡尼曼忽略了这一点），但它们在一个有模拟知识循环的世界里对我们更有利，因为那里有更多的时间来纠正错误。在今天的高速数字知识循环中，我们必须放慢自己的脚步，否则就有可能传递错误的故事。最近的一项研究表明，虚假故事在网上的传播速度比真实故事快很多倍（Vosoughi等人，2018）。 The bulk of online experiences we currently interact with are designed to exploit our cognitive and emotional biases, not to help us overcome them. Companies such as Facebook and Twitter become more valuable as they capture more of our attention by appealing to what Kahneman calls “System 1”: the parts of our brain that run automatically and that are responsible for our cognitive biases (Kahneman, 2013). You are more likely to look at cute animal pictures or status updates from your friends than to read an in-depth analysis of a proposal for a carbon tax. The recent explosion of “fake news” exploits this flaw in our systems, making large-scale manipulation possible. 我们目前与之互动的大部分在线体验都是为了利用我们的认知和情感偏见，而不是为了帮助我们克服这些偏见。诸如Facebook和Twitter这样的公司变得更有价值，因为它们通过吸引卡尼曼所说的 \"系统1\"，即我们大脑中自动运行并负责我们认知偏见的部分，来吸引我们的注意力（卡尼曼，2013）。你更有可能看可爱的动物图片或你朋友的状态更新，而不是阅读对碳税提案的深入分析。最近爆发的 \"假新闻 \"利用了我们系统中的这一缺陷，使大规模操纵成为可能。 New systems can help here. We might, for instance, imagine an online reader that presents opposing viewpoints to a given story. For each topic, you could explore both similar and opposing views. Such a reader could be presented as a browser plug-in, so that when you’ve ventured beyond the confines of a social media platform and are looking around on the Web, you could be drawn into actively exploring beyond the bounds of your usual sources (Wenger, 2011). 新的系统在这里可以提供帮助。例如，我们可以想象一个在线阅读器，它对一个给定的故事提出相反的观点。对于每个主题，你可以探索相似和反对的观点。这样的阅读器可以以浏览器插件的形式出现，这样，当你超越了社交媒体平台的限制，在网络上四处寻找时，你可以被吸引到你通常的来源范围之外进行积极探索（Wenger，2011）。 Fundamentally though, we all have to actively work on engaging what Kahneman calls “System 2”: the part of our brain that requires effort, but that lets us think independently and rationally. Developing and keeping up some kind of mindfulness practice is a key enabler for overcoming biases and freeing ourselves to learn. 但从根本上说，我们都必须积极努力地参与卡尼曼所说的 \"系统2\"：我们大脑中需要努力的部分，但它让我们独立和理性地思考。培养和保持某种正念练习是克服偏见和解放自己学习的一个关键因素。 Freedom to Create 自由创造 After learning, the next step in the knowledge loop is creating. Here again, we need to work on our freedom. As Picasso once said, “Every child is an artist. The problem is how to remain an artist [...]” As adults we censor ourselves, inhibiting the natural creativity we enjoyed as children. The educational system, with its focus on preparing for standardized tests, further crushes our creative impulses. Many people eventually come to believe that creativity is something that they’re not capable of. 学习之后，知识循环的下一步是创造。在这里，我们又需要在自由方面下功夫。正如毕加索曾经说过的，\"每个孩子都是一个艺术家。问题是如何保持艺术家的身份[...]\" 作为成年人，我们审查自己，抑制了我们在儿童时期享受的自然创造力。教育系统以准备标准化考试为重点，进一步压制了我们的创造冲动。许多人最终相信，创造力是他们没有能力做到的事情。 The job loop further solidifies these beliefs about creativity, and even institutionalizes them. Society categorizes people into amateurs and professionals. We venerate the professional guitar player, artist or sculptor but denigrate the amateur, dismissing their work as “amateurish.” When we start to measure creativity by how much money an artist or musician makes rather than the passion they feel for a pursuit, there is no wonder that many people fear they will never measure up. 工作圈进一步巩固了这些关于创造力的信念，甚至将其制度化。社会把人分为业余和专业。我们推崇专业的吉他手、艺术家或雕塑家，但却诋毁业余者，把他们的作品斥为 \"业余\"。当我们开始用艺术家或音乐家赚多少钱来衡量创造力，而不是用他们对某项追求的热情来衡量，难怪许多人担心他们永远无法达到这个标准。 Distractions also inhibit our impulses to create. There’s always another YouTube video to watch, another email to read, another post to glance at. Our brains are poorly suited to environments that are overloaded with information specifically curated to capture our attention. We evolved in a world where potentially relevant information—for instance, the sound of an approaching animal—could be a matter of life or death, and our brains are thus easily distracted. This is an example of a maladaptation to the current environment akin to our evolutionary craving for sugar in a world with added sugar everywhere. 分散注意力也抑制了我们创造的冲动。总是有另一个YouTube视频要看，另一个电子邮件要读，另一个帖子要看。我们的大脑很不适合那些专门为吸引我们的注意力而策划的超负荷信息环境。我们在一个潜在的相关信息--例如，一个接近的动物的声音--可能是一个生死攸关的问题的世界中进化，因此我们的大脑很容易分心。这是一个不适应当前环境的例子，类似于我们在进化过程中对糖的渴望，而这个世界到处都有加糖。 In order to be able to create, we need to disconnect ourselves from many of those strategically selected and concentrated stimuli. Again, a mindfulness practice will be helpful here, allowing us to tune out interruptions, and there are many hacks we can use to prevent them in the first place, such as putting our phone into Do Not Disturb (DND) mode (I keep my phone on DND at all times with only family members being able to get through—that way I use my phone when I want to and not when Facebook or Twitter want me to). 为了能够进行创作，我们需要将自己与许多有策略地选择和集中的刺激断开。同样，正念练习在这里会有帮助，使我们能够调出干扰，而且有许多小技巧我们可以用来首先防止它们，比如把我们的手机调到勿扰（DND）模式（我的手机一直保持在DND模式，只有家人能够打通，这样我想用手机的时候就用，而不是Facebook或Twitter要我用的时候）。 Freedom to Share 自由分享 Even after we have created something, many of us fear that when we share it, it will be criticized. Someone will call our painting ugly, our code incompetent, or our proposal naive. Given the state of much online commentary and the prevalence of ‘trolling,’ those fears are well-founded—but they need not inhibit our participation in the knowledge loop. Part of the answer is to work on the inner strength to continue sharing despite criticism. 即使在我们创造了一些东西之后，我们中的许多人都担心，当我们分享它时，它会被批评。有人会说我们的画很丑，我们的代码不称职，或者我们的建议很天真。考虑到许多在线评论的状况和 \"嘲弄 \"的盛行，这些担心是有根据的，但它们不需要抑制我们对知识循环的参与。答案的一部分是努力获得内在的力量，在批评声中继续分享。 Another part of the answer is that we should cultivate empathy. Whenever we comment on the work of others online, we should keep in mind that they dared to create and share it. And we should also remember that by contributing to the knowledge loop, they have engaged in the very thing that makes us human. Those who manage online communities should provide tools for flagging and banning people who are abusive or make threats aimed at shutting down sharing. 答案的另一部分是，我们应该培养同理心。每当我们在网上评论别人的作品时，我们应该牢记他们敢于创造和分享这些作品。我们还应该记住，通过对知识圈的贡献，他们参与了使我们成为人类的事情。那些管理在线社区的人应该提供工具来标记和禁止那些滥用或威胁要关闭分享的人。 If you live in a country that is subject to dictatorship, censorship or mob rule, sharing opinions, art or research can result in imprisonment, torture or even death. And yet despite that, we routinely find people who freely share in these places. We should take inspiration and courage from those people, and we should support people’s ability to build systems to enable sharing in these places that are censorship-resistant and that allow for pseudonymous and anonymous expression (even though these systems ultimately can provide only limited protection, as discussed in the earlier section on privacy). 如果你生活在一个受独裁统治、审查制度或暴民统治的国家，分享意见、艺术或研究可能导致监禁、酷刑甚至死亡。然而尽管如此，我们还是经常发现在这些地方有自由分享的人。我们应该从这些人身上得到启发和勇气，我们应该支持人们建立系统的能力，以便在这些地方实现抗审查和允许假名和匿名表达的分享（尽管这些系统最终只能提供有限的保护，正如前面关于隐私的部分所讨论的）。 In the Knowledge Age, there is such a thing as sharing too much—not sharing too much personal information, but mindlessly sharing harmful information. Threats, rumors and lies can take on lives of their own, and we can find ourselves contributing to an information cascade, in which an initial bit of information picks up speed and becomes an avalanche that destroys everything in its path. So, as with freedom in other contexts, there’s a double-edged aspect to having the psychological freedom to share. We need to free ourselves from fear to share our creations and our ideas, while also needing to control our emotional responses so that we do not poison the knowledge loop. Ask yourself whether what you’re sharing will enhance or hurt the pursuit of knowledge. If the answer is not obvious, it might be better not to share. 在信息时代，有一种情况是分享得太多--不是分享太多的个人信息，而是无意识地分享有害信息。威胁、谣言和谎言可以有自己的生命，我们可以发现自己对信息瀑布的贡献，在这种情况下，最初的一点信息会加速，变成雪崩，摧毁其路径上的一切。因此，与其他情况下的自由一样，拥有分享的心灵自由也有一个双刃剑的方面。我们需要把自己从恐惧中解放出来，以分享我们的创作和想法，同时也需要控制我们的情绪反应，以便我们不会毒害知识循环。问问自己，你所分享的东西是会提高还是会伤害对知识的追求。如果答案不明显，也许不分享更好。 Psychological Freedom and Humanism 心灵自由和人文主义 Self-regulation lies at the heart of psychological freedom, and allows us to separate our wants from our needs. It lets us consider our initial reactions to what others are saying, writing or doing without immediately reacting in anger. It lets us have empathy for others and to be open to learning something new. And it lets us overcome our fears of creating and sharing. 自我调节是心灵自由的核心，它使我们能够把我们的愿望和需求分开。它让我们考虑自己对他人所说、所写或所做的事情的最初反应，而不立即做出愤怒的反应。它让我们对他人有同情心，并乐于学习新的东西。它还让我们克服对创造和分享的恐惧。 Still, as humans we have a need for meaning that has us searching for purpose and recognition in ways that can all too easily result in us being psychologically unfree. Existential angst can express itself in many different forms, ranging from an inability to do anything to a manic desire to do everything. The persistence of religion is partly explained by its ability to address the need for meaning. Most religions claim that our purpose is to follow a set of divinely ordained rules, and that if we follow them, the respective god or gods will recognize and potentially even reward our existence. 然而，作为人类，我们有一种对意义的需求，这使我们在寻找目的和认可的过程中，很容易导致我们心理上的不自由。存在主义的焦虑可以以许多不同的形式表现出来，从什么都做不了到什么都想做的狂躁欲望。宗教的持续存在，部分原因是它能够解决对意义的需求。大多数宗教声称，我们的目的是遵循一套神圣的规则，如果我们遵循这些规则，各自的神将承认甚至有可能奖励我们的存在。 Many organized religions intentionally disrupt the knowledge loop. They restrict the process of critical inquiry by which knowledge improves over time, through mechanisms such as censorship and “divine knowledge,” which is often encoded in sacred texts. This serves to maintain the power of the gatekeepers to the texts and their interpretation. While adhering to a religion may meet your existential psychological need for meaning, it may also make it difficult for you to participate fully and freely in the knowledge loop. 许多有组织的宗教有意扰乱知识循环。他们通过审查和 \"神圣的知识 \"等机制，限制了知识随着时间的推移而改进的批判性探究过程，而这些知识往往被编码在神圣的文本中。这有助于维护文本及其解释的看门人的权力。虽然坚持宗教可能会满足你对意义的存在心理需求，但它也可能使你难以完全自由地参与到知识圈中。 The same is true for many informal beliefs. Belief in a preordained individual destiny can be used to fulfill the need for meaning, but it also acts as an obstacle to psychological freedom via thoughts such as “this was meant to be, there’s nothing I can do about it.” Or people can belong to communities that meet the need for meaning through recognition, but impose a strict conformity that restricts participation in the knowledge loop. It can often be difficult to recognize how much of one’s behavior is controlled by custom or peer pressure. 许多非正式的信仰也是如此。对预设的个人命运的信仰可以用来满足对意义的需求，但它也通过 \"这是注定的，我无能为力 \"这样的想法成为心灵自由的障碍。或者人们可以属于那些通过承认来满足意义需求的社区，但却强加了严格的一致性，限制了对知识循环的参与。要认识到一个人的行为有多少是由习俗或同伴压力控制的，往往是很困难的。 A new humanism, built around recognizing the importance of knowledge, can provide an alternative that enhances psychological freedom instead of inhibiting it. With participation in the knowledge loop as a key source of purpose, learning new things, being creative and sharing with others is encouraged. This doesn’t mean that everyone has to be the proverbial rocket scientist. There are a great many ways to participate in the knowledge loop, including creating art, as well as caring for others and the environment. 围绕承认知识的重要性而建立的新人文主义，可以提供一种增强心灵自由而不是抑制心灵自由的选择。将参与知识循环作为目的的关键来源，鼓励学习新事物，发挥创造力并与他人分享。这并不意味着每个人都必须成为传说中的火箭科学家。有很多方法可以参与知识循环，包括创造艺术，以及关心他人和环境。 In order to help people be psychologically free, we need to substantially change most countries’ education systems. Today’s systems were developed to support the Industrial Age, and their goal is to shape people to participate in the job loop. We need a system that celebrates knowledge for its own sake, allows students to discover their individual interests and deepen those into a purpose, and teaches people about how to be psychologically free. In other words, we need to put humanism at the center of learning. 为了帮助人们获得心理上的自由，我们需要大幅改变大多数国家的教育系统。今天的系统是为支持工业时代而开发的，其目标是塑造人们参与工作循环。我们需要一个为知识本身而赞美的系统，允许学生发现他们的个人兴趣，并将其深化为一个目的，并教导人们如何在心理上获得自由。换句话说，我们需要将人文主义置于学习的中心。 Humanism and the knowledge loop thus have important implications for how we can reorganize society and take responsibility for the world around us. This is the subject of Part Five. 因此，人文主义和知识循环对我们如何重组社会并对我们周围的世界负责有重要的影响。这就是第五部分的主题。 "},"docs/Part_Five_Taking_Action.html":{"url":"docs/Part_Five_Taking_Action.html","title":"第五部分：采取行动","keywords":"","body":"第五部分： 采取行动 Even if you’re now convinced of the importance of the knowledge loop and attention scarcity in the digital age, and persuaded by my suggestions for increasing economic, informational and psychological freedom, that still leaves a huge question: can it be done? 即使你现在已经意识到了在数字时代中知识循环和注意力稀缺的重要性，也被我的建议增加经济、信息和心灵自由所说服，但仍然存在一个巨大的问题：这能行吗？ You may think my proposals to change everything from how money is created to who controls computation are too extreme. You may dismiss them as utopian and argue that we cannot change everything about how we live. And yet to do so ignores the fact that we have already changed everything twice. Each of our two prior shifts in scarcity—from food in the Forager Age to land in the Agrarian Age, and from land to capital in the Industrial Age—was accompanied by extraordinary transformations. 你可能认为我改变从货币创造到控制计算的建议太过极端。你可能认为这是乌托邦主义，并认为我们不能改变我们生活的方方面面。然而，这忽略了一个事实：我们已经两次彻底改变了一切。我们两次先前的从食物到土地、从土地到资本的稀缺性转移伴随着非同寻常的转变 When we transitioned from the Forager Age to the Agrarian Age, we went from nomadic to sedentary, from egalitarian to hierarchical, from promiscuous to monogamous and from animistic to theistic religions. When we went from the Agrarian Age to the Industrial Age, we moved from the countryside to cities, from large extended families to nuclear ones, from commons to private property, and from great-chain-of-being theologies to the Protestant work ethic. Though the first of these transitions took place over millennia and the second one over centuries, they still show that a shift in the binding scarcity comes with profound changes in how we live. 当我们从采集时代过渡到农业时代，我们从游牧到定居，从平等到等级制，从杂交到一夫一妻制，从泛灵论到神论宗教。当我们从农业时代进入工业时代时，我们从农村走向城市，从大型家庭走向核心家庭，从公共资源走向私有财产，从神权政治走向工作伦理。虽然这两次转变分别发生在几千年和几个世纪之间，但它们仍然表明，一种约束性稀缺性的转变会带来我们生活方式的深刻变化。 With scarcity shifting once more, from capital to attention, we will again have to change everything—no matter how daunting that may seem. What follows is a series of ideas for how each of us can contribute to that change. There are many different projects to be tackled—my list is far from exhaustive, and should be regarded as inspiration for how we can take responsibility. 现在，稀缺性再次从资本转向了注意力，我们再次必须彻底改变一切，无论这看起来多么艰巨。接下来是一系列关于我们每个人如何为这种变革做出贡献的想法。有许多不同的项目需要解决——我的清单远非详尽，应该被视为激发我们承担责任的灵感。 ‍ "},"docs/Part_Five_Taking_Action/Growing_Mindfulness.html":{"url":"docs/Part_Five_Taking_Action/Growing_Mindfulness.html","title":"正念练习","keywords":"","body":"正念练习 One action we should all take is the development of a mindfulness practice. The word ‘mindfulness’ is used a lot and is easy to dismiss, but for the reasons discussed in the section on psychological freedom, without such a practice it will be difficult to participate fully in the other actions discussed below. We each need to find out what works for us, whether it’s meditation, yoga, running or something else entirely. I do a conscious breathing exercise every day, first thing in the morning and last thing in the evening. I started doing this about five years ago and the change in my life has been profound. 我们都应该采取的一个行动是发展正念练习。正念 \"这个词被用得很多，而且很容易被忽视，但由于心灵自由一节中讨论的原因，如果没有这样的练习，将很难充分参与下面讨论的其他行动。我们每个人都需要找出适合自己的方法，无论是冥想、瑜伽、跑步还是其他完全不同的东西。我每天都做有意识的呼吸练习，早上第一件事，晚上最后一件事。我大约五年前开始这样做，我的生活发生了深刻的变化。 It is also important that we help and inspire other people to do the same. There have been discussions on whether or not math should be mandatory in school, but there has been no such debate around mindfulness. It is entirely possible to go through school and college or university without developing a practice of one’s own. Every one of us would be better off with more mindfulness—the same cannot be said about algebra. 同样重要的是，我们要帮助和激励其他人也这样做。人们一直在讨论数学是否应该成为学校的必修课，但围绕正念却没有这样的辩论。通过学校和学院或大学而不发展自己的练习是完全可能的。我们每个人都会因为有更多的心智而变得更好--这一点在代数方面不能说。 Another way to contribute to the spread of mindfulness is through research and entrepreneurship. Much remains to be understood about how different techniques, or drugs such as psilocybin, influence our brains. There is plenty of room for services such as individualized coaching, and for more apps that help with meditation and conscious breathing. 另一种促进正念传播的方式是通过研究和创业。关于不同的技术或药物（如迷幻药）如何影响我们的大脑，还有很多东西有待了解。个人化辅导等服务，以及更多帮助冥想和有意识呼吸的应用程序，都有很大的空间。 "},"docs/Part_Five_Taking_Action/Fighting_the_Climate_Crisis.html":{"url":"docs/Part_Five_Taking_Action/Fighting_the_Climate_Crisis.html","title":"应对全球气候危机","keywords":"","body":"应对全球气候危机 The climate crisis is the single biggest collective problem facing humanity. If we fail to direct attention and resources to fighting it, the climate crisis will make the transition from the Industrial Age worse than the transition into it, which involved two world wars. This may sound hyperbolic, but the climate crisis represents an existential risk for humanity. 气候危机是人类面临的唯一最大的集体问题。如果我们不能将注意力和资源用于对抗它，气候危机将使从工业时代的过渡比进入工业时代的过渡更糟糕，因为后者涉及两次世界大战。这听起来可能很夸张，但气候危机代表了人类的生存风险。 Every day, unimaginable amounts of energy hit the Earth in the form of sunlight. Much of this energy is radiated back into space, but greenhouse gases reduce the Earth’s ability to shed heat and instead keep it trapped inside the atmosphere. To get a sense of how much heat we are talking about, we can express it in terms of Hiroshima-sized nuclear bombs. Compared to pre-industrial times, how much more heat would you guess the Earth is retaining? The equivalent of one nuclear bomb per year? Per month? Per week? Per day? The reality is that the extra heat being trapped amounts to four nuclear bombs per second, of every minute, of every hour, of every day, three hundred and sixty-five days a year. 每天，难以想象的大量能量以阳光的形式照射到地球上。这些能量大部分被辐射回太空，但是温室气体降低了地球散发热量的能力，而是将其困在大气层中。为了了解我们正在谈论的热量是多少，我们可以用广岛大小的核弹来表示。与工业化前的时代相比，你猜地球保留了多少热量？相当于每年一颗核弹？每个月？每星期？每一天？现实情况是，被截留的额外热量相当于每秒四颗核弹，每分钟、每小时、每一天，一年三百六十五天。 Imagine for a moment that alien spaceships were dropping four nuclear bombs into our atmosphere every second. What would we do? We would drop everything else to fight them. This is, of course, roughly the plot of the movie Independence Day. Except with the climate crisis it’s not aliens, it’s ourselves, and it’s not bright explosions, it’s all the molecules in the atmosphere and in the oceans wiggling a bit harder (that’s what it means for something to heat up). 想象一下，如果外星飞船每秒钟向我们的大气层投下四颗核弹。我们会怎么做？我们会放下其他一切来对抗它们。当然，这大概就是电影《独立日》的情节。只是在气候危机中，不是外星人，而是我们自己，也不是明亮的爆炸，而是大气和海洋中的所有分子都在用力扭动（这就是东西升温的意思）。 There are many ways to fight the climate crisis. They include making personal changes such as switching to electric heating, voting for politicians who are committed to tackling the problem, and becoming active in movements such as Extinction Rebellion. As with mindfulness, research and entrepreneurship provide crucial avenues for action. For instance, there are many questions in how to make nuclear fusion work (which would provide a clean source of abundant electricity) or how to most effectively draw down greenhouse gases from the atmosphere. There are companies to be founded that will further the adoption of solar power, not just here in the U.S. but in the developing world. 有许多方法可以对抗气候危机。它们包括做出个人改变，如改用电暖气，投票给那些致力于解决这个问题的政治家，并积极参加诸如 \"灭绝叛乱 \"等运动。与正念一样，研究和企业家精神为行动提供了关键的途径。例如，在如何使核聚变工作（这将提供丰富的清洁电力来源）或如何最有效地从大气中吸取温室气体方面，存在着许多问题。有一些公司的成立将进一步推动太阳能的采用，不仅是在美国，而且在发展中国家。 "},"docs/Part_Five_Taking_Action/Defending_Democracy.html":{"url":"docs/Part_Five_Taking_Action/Defending_Democracy.html","title":"捍卫民主","keywords":"","body":"捍卫民主 What is the political process by which we should achieve the profound changes that are required? We are seeing some leaders emerge in this period of transition who provide simplistic, populist answers to difficult questions, advocating a return to the past. There is a danger around the world, including here in the United States, that we will slide into dictatorship and other forms of autocratic government. 我们应该通过什么样的政治进程来实现所需的深刻变革？我们看到在这个过渡时期出现了一些领导人，他们对困难的问题提供了简单化、民粹化的答案，主张回到过去。世界各地，包括美国这里，都存在着一种危险，即我们将滑向独裁和其他形式的专制政府。 Democracy is the only system of government in which the knowledge loop can function to its full potential. Democracy allows new policies to be tested, with a peaceful transition to another set of policies if they don’t work. As tempting as a quick autocratic fix might seem, we need to figure out what it takes to have a working democracy. Some things seem obvious, such as limiting the influence of money in politics. 民主是唯一的政府系统，在这种系统中，知识循环可以充分发挥其潜力。民主允许对新政策进行测试，如果它们不起作用，可以和平过渡到另一套政策。尽管快速的专制解决方法可能看起来很诱人，但我们需要弄清楚，要想拥有一个有效的民主制度，需要做些什么。有些事情似乎很明显，比如限制金钱在政治中的影响。 Because attention is scarce, it can be bought, either by raising and spending a lot of money, or by doing or saying outrageous things. Neither is good for democracy: the former because it makes candidates beholden to the interests of their backers, and the latter because it results in polarization rather than critical debate. 因为注意力是稀缺的，所以可以通过筹集和花费大量资金，或者通过做或说一些离谱的事情来购买。两者都不利于民主：前者是因为它使候选人受制于其支持者的利益，后者是因为它导致了两极分化而不是批判性辩论。 Going forward, we should experiment with new forms of democracy. Given the complexity of the modern world, I am in favor of specialization and delegated voting. We should explore forms of democracy in which I can delegate my vote to people I trust on specific issues, such as energy policy. These delegates, in turn, would elect a leader for the energy agency based on their proposed policies. 展望未来，我们应该尝试新的民主形式。鉴于现代世界的复杂性，我赞成专业化和委托投票。我们应该探索民主的形式，在具体问题上，例如能源政策，我可以把我的投票权委托给我信任的人。这些代表又会根据他们提出的政策为能源机构选出一位领导人。 A more extreme version of this, which is worth exploring in the context of the climate crisis, is a so-called ‘citizens’ assembly.’ Citizens would be selected at random from the population to form an assembly and given access to experts in the field. With the experts’ help, they would come up with a plan that is then either implemented right away or put to a vote. This idea recalls Athenian democracy, which relied on the random selection of citizens for various government functions. The advantage of such an approach is that it would shortcut long electoral cycles and allow for policies to be chosen that might not be popular with any one party. For example, Ireland recently successfully used a citizens’ assembly to develop an abortion policy. 一个更极端的版本是所谓的 \"公民大会\"，这在气候危机的背景下值得探讨。公民将从人口中随机选出，组成一个议会，并获得接触该领域专家的机会。在专家的帮助下，他们将提出一个计划，然后要么立即实施，要么付诸表决。这个想法让人想起雅典的民主，它依靠随机选择公民来履行各种政府职能。这种方法的好处是，它可以缩短漫长的选举周期，并允许选择可能不受任何一个政党欢迎的政策。例如，爱尔兰最近成功地利用公民大会来制定堕胎政策。 These are just two of many possible variations of how democracy can work. With digital technologies, we have options that were not previously feasible. Take, for example, the town of Jun in Spain, which uses Twitter as the primary communication channel between citizens and local government officials (Powers & Roy, 2018). We should start to explore more of these possibilities, and part of that means revisiting the geographic units we use for decision-making. The key principle here is that decisions should be made at the lowest possible level. We need to make some decisions globally, such as limiting greenhouse gases, but how we achieve that should be decided at lower levels. 这些只是民主如何运作的许多可能变化中的两个。有了数字技术，我们有了以前不可行的选择。以西班牙的Jun镇为例，它使用Twitter作为公民和当地政府官员之间的主要沟通渠道（Powers & Roy, 2018）。我们应该开始探索更多这些可能性，其中一部分意味着重新审视我们用于决策的地理单元。这里的关键原则是，应该在尽可能低的水平上做出决定。我们需要在全球范围内做出一些决定，如限制温室气体，但如何实现这一目标应在较低层次上决定。 Making decisions at the lowest possible level, a principle known as ‘subsidiarity,’ is especially important during a time of great change. For instance, what is possible in education is changing rapidly due to digital technology, so we should allow experimentation at a local level. By running many small experiments, we can more rapidly figure what works well. 在尽可能低的层次上做决定，这是一个被称为 \"辅助性 \"的原则，在大变革时期尤其重要。例如，由于数字技术的发展，教育的可能性正在迅速变化，所以我们应该允许在地方一级进行实验。通过运行许多小的实验，我们可以更迅速地弄清什么是有效的。 Most of all, we need to reject attempts at dictatorship and autocracy. These effectively disable the knowledge loop because they cannot tolerate freedom of expression—their power is based on suppressing criticism. This is especially dangerous in a time of transition that requires debating and implementing new ideas. There are many ways of defending democracy, starting with the obvious one of voting against would-be dictators. Of course, speaking out against them once they are in power is also crucial, even if it comes at high personal cost. Finally, building and participating in systems that support uncensorable, anonymous or pseudonymous expression is a crucial action to help undermine dictatorships. 最重要的是，我们需要拒绝独裁和专制的企图。这些都有效地破坏了知识的循环，因为他们不能容忍言论自由--他们的权力是建立在压制批评的基础上。在一个需要辩论和实施新思想的转型时期，这一点尤其危险。捍卫民主的方法有很多，首先是投票反对可能的独裁者这一明显的方法。当然，一旦他们掌权，大声反对他们也是至关重要的，即使这需要付出高昂的个人代价。最后，建立和参与支持不可审查、匿名或假名表达的系统，是帮助破坏独裁政权的关键行动。 "},"docs/Part_Five_Taking_Action/Fostering_Decentralization.html":{"url":"docs/Part_Five_Taking_Action/Fostering_Decentralization.html","title":"权利下放","keywords":"","body":"权利下放 As I have previously described, most developed countries have large central governments with a high degree of centralized decision-making. That is complemented by a high degree of concentration in the economy, with a few firms dominating most industries. Both of these things are bad for the knowledge loop, as they inhibit experimentation. A recent example of this was illustrated by the response to COVID-19. In the US, testing was largely federally controlled, making it difficult to execute a differentiated state-level response. Even a state the size of California, which on a standalone basis would be the world’s sixth largest economy, was unable to approve rapid tests developed by California-based startups (Haverstock, 2020). 正如我之前所描述的，大多数发达国家都有大型中央政府，决策高度集中。与此相辅相成的是经济的高度集中，少数公司支配着大多数行业。这两点都不利于知识循环，因为它们抑制了实验。最近的一个例子是对COVID-19的反应说明了这一点。在美国，测试在很大程度上是由联邦控制的，这使得很难执行一个有区别的州级反应。即使是像加利福尼亚这样大的州，在独立的基础上也是世界第六大经济体，也无法批准由加利福尼亚的初创公司开发的快速测试（Haverstock, 2020）。 We can take many actions to help foster a return to decentralization. For example, where it is permitted, parents can choose to home school their children with other parents, forming experimental education pods. More importantly, we can participate in the burgeoning field of blockchain technologies. The best known blockchain is Bitcoin, a digital alternative to gold. 我们可以采取许多行动来帮助促进权力下放的回归。例如，在允许的情况下，父母可以选择与其他父母一起在家里教育他们的孩子，形成实验性的教育舱。更重要的是，我们可以参与到蓬勃发展的区块链技术领域。最知名的区块链是比特币，是黄金的数字替代品。 Blockchains are decentralized networks that can nonetheless achieve consensus, such as on how many Bitcoin are controlled by which address on the network. This matters because as we saw earlier, much of the power of companies such as Facebook, Google or Amazon comes from network effects. Government power is also derived from a network effect that arises from the ability to issue currency and regulate banking. Building decentralized alternatives to these systems using blockchain technology is a way of removing power from government and large corporations. 区块链是去中心化的网络，但仍然可以达成共识，比如在网络上哪个地址控制了多少比特币。这很重要，因为正如我们之前看到的，Facebook、谷歌或亚马逊等公司的大部分权力来自于网络效应。政府的权力也来自于发行货币和监管银行业的能力所产生的网络效应。利用区块链技术建立这些系统的去中心化替代方案，是消除政府和大公司权力的一种方式。 As it turns out, when blockchains work properly they are uncensorable. Unless a government or corporation can take over a large percentage of the nodes on a blockchain network, the information maintained by the network will continue to be propagated correctly, even when some nodes are trying to purge or manipulate the contents. The only option governments face is to cut their population off from accessing the networks, and this requires a high degree of control over all Internet traffic (as has been achieved, for example, by China). This is why fighting against national ‘firewalls’ is so important. 事实证明，当区块链正常工作时，它们是不可审查的。除非政府或公司能够接管区块链网络上很大比例的节点，否则网络维护的信息将继续正确传播，即使有些节点试图清除或操纵内容。政府面临的唯一选择是切断其人口对网络的访问，而这需要对所有互联网流量进行高度控制（例如，中国已经实现了）。这就是为什么反对国家 \"防火墙 \"的斗争如此重要。 While any one new blockchain system has a high likelihood of failing, the large number of current experiments will produce systems that have the potential to be transformative on a global scale. One of the most exciting possibilities is that we may end up with UBI built outside of existing government budgets as part of a cryptocurrency. A variety of projects are currently attempting this, including Circles and the $UBI token. 虽然任何一个新的区块链系统都有很大的可能性失败，但目前大量的实验将产生有可能在全球范围内改变的系统。最令人兴奋的可能性之一是，我们最终可能会在现有政府预算之外建立UBI，作为加密货币的一部分。目前有各种项目正在尝试这样做，包括Circles和$UBI代币。 To be clear, decentralization and blockchains do not represent a panacea. Some problems require centralization to be solved (for instance, water and sewage are centrally controlled for a reason). And decentralization can bring its own problems, such as the potential aggravation of the ‘Cyber-Balkans’ problem that we encountered earlier. But at a time of excessive centralization, it is crucial that we foster decentralization to act as a counterweight. 说白了，去中心化和区块链并不代表万能药。有些问题需要集中化来解决（例如，水和污水被集中控制是有原因的）。而去中心化也会带来自己的问题，比如我们之前遇到的'网络巴尔干'问题可能会加剧。但是，在过度集中化的时候，我们必须促进权力下放，以作为一种平衡。 "},"docs/Part_Five_Taking_Action/Improving_Learning.html":{"url":"docs/Part_Five_Taking_Action/Improving_Learning.html","title":"改善学习","keywords":"","body":"改善学习 Learning is the hardest step in the knowledge loop. How many of us say something like “I wish I could play the guitar,” but either never do anything about it or give up after a short period?

There has been plenty of recent progress here: for example, Duolingo has made language learning more accessible by breaking it down into small units that are customized to each learner. 学习是知识循环中最难的一步。我们有多少人说过 \"我希望我会弹吉他 \"这样的话，但要么从未做任何事情，要么在很短的时间内就放弃了？学习是困难的，我们应该努力使它更容易、更有趣、更社会化。最近在这方面有很多进展：例如，Duolingo将语言学习分解成小单元，为每个学习者定制，从而使语言学习更加容易。 I am personally excited about helping to create two particular projects. One is an integrated platform for learning math, programming, engineering and science. These areas of knowledge are closely related, yet the way we teach them is often oddly disconnected. The other project is a compendium of the principles of knowledge. We have so much knowledge that it seems impossible to know more than a tiny fraction of it all, but this is partly an illusion because much of it is a variation or an application of a much smaller set of underlying principles. Collecting and explaining these will make knowledge more accessible and help to unify areas that seem unrelated. 我个人对帮助创建两个特殊项目感到兴奋。一个是用于学习数学、编程、工程和科学的综合平台。这些知识领域是密切相关的，但我们教授它们的方式往往是奇怪的脱节的。另一个项目是一个知识原理的汇编。我们有如此多的知识，似乎不可能知道其中的一小部分，但这部分是一种错觉，因为大部分知识是一套更小的基本原则的变化或应用。收集和解释这些原则将使知识更容易获得，并有助于统一那些看起来不相关的领域。 While the COVID-19 crisis has come at a terrible cost, it has also accelerated innovation in learning. Many parents are discovering that home schooling their children, whether individually or in small groups, may be a viable option. There are many ways to encourage learning that is based on fostering our innate curiosity, from simply learning something new oneself to inventing and building new systems. 虽然COVID-19危机带来了可怕的代价，但它也加速了学习的创新。许多家长发现，让孩子在家里上学，无论是个人还是小组，都可能是一个可行的选择。有许多方法可以鼓励基于培养我们天生的好奇心的学习，从简单的自己学习新东西到发明和建立新系统。 "},"docs/Part_Five_Taking_Action/Promoting_and_Living_Humanism.html":{"url":"docs/Part_Five_Taking_Action/Promoting_and_Living_Humanism.html","title":"弘扬和践行人文精神","keywords":"","body":"Promoting and Living Humanism 倡导和践行人文主义 Given the limits of capitalism that we explored earlier, we might find socialism or even some form of Marxism tempting. That too, however, represents a return to a populist past rather than an invention of the future. The alternatives that people commonly propose are also Industrial Age thinking, rooted in the scarcity of capital. As should be clear by now, my proposals are effectively about shrinking capitalism, much as we previously shrunk agriculture, to make room for participation in the knowledge loop. 鉴于我们之前探讨的资本主义的局限性，我们可能会发现社会主义甚至某种形式的马克思主义很诱人。然而，这也代表着回归到民粹主义的过去，而不是对未来的发明。人们通常提出的替代方案也是工业时代的思维，扎根于资本的稀缺性。现在应该很清楚，我的建议实际上是在缩小资本主义，就像我们以前缩小农业一样，为参与知识圈腾出空间。 Central to this project is the promotion of humanism and the policies associated with it, such as the adoption of UBI. Everyone can take action on this, from contributing to UBI trials to creating content under a Creative Commons license. 这个项目的核心是促进人文主义和与之相关的政策，如采用UBI。每个人都可以就此采取行动，从为UBI试验做贡献到在知识共享许可下创建内容。 We can also promote humanism by applying humanist values to our everyday decision-making. The starting point for this is to see ourselves as human first, with nationality, faith, gender and race all a distant second. I realize that this is easier for me as a white male living in the United States, but that removes nothing from the underlying values of humanism. I described some of these in the earlier chapter on humanism, but here is a more complete list. 我们还可以通过在日常决策中运用人文主义价值观来促进人文主义。这样做的出发点是首先把自己看成是人，国籍、信仰、性别和种族都在其次。我意识到，作为一个生活在美国的白人男性，这对我来说比较容易，但这并不妨碍人文主义的基本价值观。我在前面关于人文主义的章节中描述了其中的一些内容，但这里有一个更完整的清单。 Solidarity: There are nearly 8 billion people living on a planet that does not easily support human life, in an otherwise inhospitable solar system. We need to support each other above all else, irrespective of such differences as gender, race or nationality. The big problems that humanity faces, such as the climate crisis, will impact all of us and require our combined effort. 团结一致： 有近80亿人生活在一个不容易支持人类生活的星球上，在一个不适宜居住的太阳系里。我们需要相互支持，不分性别、种族或国籍等差异。人类面临的大问题，如气候危机，将影响我们所有人，需要我们共同努力。 Diversity: We are all unique, and we should celebrate these differences. They are beautiful and a part of our humanity. 多样性： 我们都是独一无二的，我们应该庆祝这些差异。它们是美丽的，是我们人性的一部分。 Responsibility: Only humans have the power of knowledge, so we are responsible for other species. For example, we are responsible for whales rather than the other way round. 责任： 只有人类拥有知识的力量，所以我们要对其他物种负责。例如，我们要对鲸鱼负责，而不是反过来。 Non-violence: Mental or bodily harm reduces or removes our ability to contribute to humanity. We must avoid it wherever possible. 非暴力： 精神或身体上的伤害减少或消除了我们对人类作出贡献的能力。我们必须尽可能地避免它。 Mindfulness: Our brain is capable of a broad range of emotions, but when they hijack us we lose our capacity to think rationally. Mindfulness is the ability to experience our emotions while retaining our ability to analyze issues and come up with creative solutions. 心态： 我们的大脑能够产生广泛的情绪，但当它们劫持我们时，我们就会失去理性思考的能力。正念是体验我们情绪的能力，同时保留我们分析问题和提出创造性解决方案的能力。 Joyfulness: While we are capable of many emotions, moments of joy are what makes life worth living. 快乐： 虽然我们能够有很多情绪，但快乐的时刻是使生活有意义的。 Criticism: When we see something that could be improved, we need to have the ability to express that. Individuals, companies and societies that do not allow criticism become stagnant and ultimately fail. 批评： 当我们看到一些可以改进的东西时，我们需要有能力来表达。不允许批评的个人、公司和社会会停滞不前，最终失败。 Innovation: Beyond criticism, the major mode for improvement is to create new ideas, products and art. Without innovation, systems become stagnant and start to decay. 创新： 除了批评，改进的主要模式是创造新的想法、产品和艺术。没有创新，系统就会停滞不前，开始衰败。 Optimism: We need to believe that problems can be solved. Without optimism we will stop trying, and problems like the climate crisis will become bigger, until they threaten human extinction. 乐观主义： 我们需要相信问题是可以解决的。如果没有乐观主义，我们将停止尝试，像气候危机这样的问题将变得更大，直到威胁到人类的灭绝。 These values can help us think through the moral problems we face as we enter the Knowledge Age. That will make a good subject for a separate book, so here is just one example: should we kill animals to feed ourselves? One answer is that we stop eating meat and become vegetarian or vegan; another is that we work out how to grow meat in a lab. Both are valid answers under the humanist approach. Continuing to eat animals without working on alternatives—standing still with the status quo, in which we do not live up to our responsibility—is not. 这些价值观可以帮助我们思考我们在进入信息时代时面临的道德问题。这将是一本单独的书的好主题，所以这里只是一个例子：我们是否应该杀死动物来养活自己？一个答案是我们停止吃肉，成为素食主义者或素食主义者；另一个答案是我们研究如何在实验室中种植肉。根据人文主义的方法，这两种答案都是有效的。继续吃动物而不研究替代方案--维持现状，我们没有履行我们的责任--则不是。 "},"docs/Conclusion.html":{"url":"docs/Conclusion.html","title":"结论","keywords":"","body":"结论 We need to act with great urgency during this transition to the Knowledge Age. We are woefully behind in dealing with the climate crisis, and there is a real possibility that as its consequences unfold, society will degenerate into violence. In the longer term, we face a potential threat from the possible rise of superintelligences, and there is also a chance that we are not alone in this universe. These are risks that we can only deal with if we stop clinging to the Industrial Age and instead embrace the Knowledge Age. Conversely, if we are able to make the transition, huge opportunities lie ahead of us. 在这个向信息时代过渡的过程中，我们需要非常紧急地采取行动。我们在处理气候危机方面落后得很厉害，而且随着其后果的展开，社会确实有可能堕落为暴力。从长远来看，我们面临着超级智能可能崛起的潜在威胁，而且还有可能在这个宇宙中我们并不孤单。这些风险，只有当我们不再依附于工业时代，而是拥抱信息时代时，我们才能应对。相反，如果我们能够实现过渡，巨大的机会就在我们面前。 A Dangerous Spiral 危险的螺旋 The world is rapidly being pulled apart by people who want to take us back to the past, as well as people who are advancing technology while being trapped in Industrial Age thinking. As I described in the introduction, technology increases the space of the possible, but it does not automatically make everyone better off. Bound to an Industrial Age logic, automation is currently enriching a few, while putting pressure on large sections of society. Nor does digital publishing automatically accelerate the knowledge loop—we find ourselves in a world plagued by fake news and filter bubbles. 世界正在迅速被那些想让我们回到过去的人拉开，以及那些在推进技术的同时却被困在工业时代思维的人。正如我在导言中所描述的，技术增加了可能的空间，但它并不自动使每个人都变得更好。受制于工业时代的逻辑，自动化目前正在使少数人致富，同时给社会的大部分人带来压力。数字出版也不会自动加速知识循环--我们发现自己处在一个被假新闻和过滤泡沫困扰的世界。 Those who are trying to take us back into the past are exploiting these trends. They promise those negatively affected by technology that everything will be better, while investing heavily in mass manipulation. They seek to curtail the open Internet, while simultaneously building up secret surveillance. This is true on both sides of the American political spectrum. Neither the Republicans nor the Democrats have a truly forward-looking platform, and both favor governmental controls over online platforms and speech, instead of empowering end-users as described in the section on informational freedom. 那些试图把我们带回过去的人正在利用这些趋势。他们向那些受到技术负面影响的人承诺，一切都会好起来，同时大量投资于大规模的操纵行为。他们试图遏制开放的互联网，同时建立秘密监控。美国政治光谱的两边都是如此。共和党和民主党都没有一个真正具有前瞻性的平台，他们都赞成政府对网络平台和言论的控制，而不是像信息自由一节中描述的那样赋予终端用户权力。 The net effects of this are an increase in polarization and a breakdown of critical inquiry and democracy. As disturbing as it is, the possibility of large-scale violent conflict, both within and between nations, is increasing, while the climate crisis wreaks havoc on industrial and food supply chains around the world. At the same time, our ability to solve the problem of climate change is decreasing, because we are spiraling back towards the past directing our attention to nationalism. 其净影响是两极分化的加剧和批判性调查与民主的崩溃。虽然令人不安，但在气候危机对世界各地的工业和食品供应链造成破坏的同时，国家内部和国家之间发生大规模暴力冲突的可能性正在增加。同时，我们解决气候变化问题的能力正在下降，因为我们正在螺旋式地回到过去，把注意力引向民族主义。 Transhumans, Neohumans and Superintelligence 超人类、新人类和超级智能 There’s another reason for urgency in navigating the transition to the Knowledge Age: we find ourselves on the threshold of creating both transhumans and neohumans. ‘Transhumans’ are humans with capabilities enhanced through both genetic modification (for example, via CRISPR gene editing) and digital augmentation (for example, the brain-machine interface Neuralink). ‘Neohumans’ are machines with artificial general intelligence. I’m including them both here, because both can be full-fledged participants in the knowledge loop. 在向信息时代过渡的过程中，还有一个紧迫的原因：我们发现自己正处在创造超人类和新人类的门槛上。超人类 \"是指通过基因改造（例如，通过CRISPR基因编辑）和数字增强（例如，脑机接口Neuralink）增强能力的人类。Neohumans \"是具有人工通用智能的机器。我在这里把它们都包括在内，因为它们都可以成为知识循环中的正式参与者。 Both transhumans and neohumans may eventually become a form of ‘superintelligence,’ and pose a threat to humanity. The philosopher Nick Bostrom published a book on the subject, and he and other thinkers warn that a superintelligence could have catastrophic results. Rather than rehashing their arguments here, I want to pursue a different line of inquiry: what would a future superintelligence learn about humanist values from our current behavior? 超人类和新人类最终都可能成为一种 \"超级智能 \"的形式，并对人类构成威胁。哲学家尼克-博斯特罗姆（Nick Bostrom）就这个问题出版了一本书，他和其他思想家警告说，超级智能可能会产生灾难性的结果。我不想在这里重提他们的论点，而是想追求一个不同的调查方向：未来的超级智能会从我们目前的行为中学习到什么人文主义价值观？ As we have seen, we’re not doing terribly well on the central humanist value of critical inquiry. We’re also not treating other species well, our biggest failing in this area being industrial meat production. Here as with many other problems that humans have created, I believe the best way forward is innovation. I’m excited about lab-grown meat and plant-based meat substitutes. Improving our treatment of other species is an important way in which we can use the attention freed up by automation. 正如我们所看到的，我们在批判性探究这一人文主义核心价值方面做得不是很好。我们也没有很好地对待其他物种，我们在这个领域最大的失败是工业化肉类生产。就像人类造成的其他许多问题一样，我相信最好的办法是创新。我对实验室培育的肉类和基于植物的肉类替代品感到兴奋。改善我们对其他物种的待遇是一种重要的方式，我们可以利用自动化所释放的注意力。 Even more important, however, is our treatment of other humans. This has two components: how we treat each other now, and how we will treat the new humans when they arrive. As for how we treat each other now, we have a long way to go. Many of my proposals are aimed at freeing humans so they can discover and pursue their personal interests and purpose, while existing education and job loop systems stand in opposition to this freedom. In particular we need to construct the Knowledge Age in a way that allows us to overcome, rather than reinforce, our biological differences which have been used as justification for so much existing discrimination and mistreatment. That will be a crucial model for transhuman and neohuman superintelligences, as they will not have our biological constraints. 然而，更重要的是我们对其他人类的待遇。这有两个组成部分：我们现在如何对待对方，以及当新人类到来时我们将如何对待他们。至于我们现在如何对待对方，我们有很长的路要走。我的许多建议都是为了解放人类，使他们能够发现和追求他们的个人兴趣和目的，而现有的教育和工作循环系统却与这种自由相对立。特别是我们需要以一种能够让我们克服而不是加强我们的生物差异的方式来构建信息时代，因为我们的生物差异一直被用作现有的许多歧视和虐待的理由。这将是超人类和新人类超级智能的一个重要模式，因为他们不会有我们的生物限制。 Finally, how will we treat the new humans? This is a difficult question to answer because it sounds so preposterous. Should machines have human rights? If they are humans, then they clearly should. My approach to what makes humans human—the ability to create and make use of knowledge—would also apply to artificial general intelligence. Does an artificial general intelligence need to have emotions in order to qualify? Does it require consciousness? These are difficult questions to answer but we need to tackle them urgently. Since these new humans will likely share little of our biological hardware, there is no reason to expect that their emotions or consciousness should be similar to ours. As we charge ahead, this is an important area for further work. We would not want to accidentally create a large class of new humans, not recognize them, and then mistreat them. 最后，我们将如何对待新人类？这是一个很难回答的问题，因为它听起来很荒唐。机器应该有人权吗？如果它们是人类，那么它们显然应该。我对人类之所以为人类的方法--创造和利用知识的能力--也将适用于人工通用智能。人工通用智能是否需要有情感才算合格？它是否需要有意识？这些都是难以回答的问题，但我们迫切需要解决这些问题。由于这些新人类很可能与我们的生物硬件几乎没有共同之处，所以没有理由期望他们的情感或意识应该与我们相似。当我们向前冲时，这是一个需要进一步工作的重要领域。我们不希望意外地创造出一大类新人类，不承认他们，然后虐待他们。 The Fermi Paradox and Alien Visitors 费米悖论和外来访客 I want to provide one final reason for urgency in getting to the Knowledge Age. It is easy for us to think of ourselves as the center of the universe. In early cosmology we put the Earth at the center, before we eventually figured out that we live on a small planet circling a star, in a galaxy that lies in an undistinguished location in an incomprehensibly large universe. More recently, we have discovered that the universe contains a great many planets more or less like ours, which means some form of intelligent life may have arisen elsewhere. This possibility leads to many fascinating questions, one of which is known as the Fermi paradox: if there is so much potential for intelligent life in the universe, why have we not yet picked up any signals? 我想为进入信息时代的紧迫性提供一个最后的理由。我们很容易认为自己是宇宙的中心。在早期的宇宙学中，我们把地球放在中心，然后我们最终发现，我们生活在一个小行星上，围绕着一颗恒星，在一个星系中，位于一个难以理解的大宇宙中的一个不显眼的位置。最近，我们发现，宇宙中包含了大量或多或少与我们相似的行星，这意味着某种形式的智能生命可能已经在其他地方出现了。这种可能性导致了许多迷人的问题，其中一个问题被称为费米悖论：如果宇宙中存在如此多的智能生命潜力，为什么我们还没有发现任何信号？ There are different possible answers to this question. For instance, perhaps civilizations get to a point similar to ours and then destroy themselves because they cannot make a crucial transition. Given the way we are handling our current transition, that seems like a distinct possibility. Maybe all intelligent civilizations encounter a problem that they cannot solve, such as the climate crisis, and either disappear entirely or suffer a collapse in knowledge and technology. Given the scale of cosmic time and space, short-lived broadcast civilizations like ours would be unlikely to be detected in any small spatiotemporal range. Furthermore, while climate change is a clear and present danger, there are also many other species-level challenges (Ord, 2021). 对这个问题有不同的可能答案。例如，也许文明到了与我们相似的地步，然后自我毁灭，因为他们不能进行关键的过渡。鉴于我们处理当前过渡的方式，这似乎是一种明显的可能性。也许所有的智慧文明都遇到了它们无法解决的问题，比如气候危机，要么完全消失，要么遭遇知识和技术的崩溃。考虑到宇宙时间和空间的规模，像我们这样的短命广播文明将不太可能在任何小的时空范围内被发现。此外，虽然气候变化是一个明显的现实危险，但也有许多其他物种层面的挑战（Ord，2021）。 A different answer to the Fermi paradox would present a different challenge: more advanced civilizations may have gone dark so as to not be discovered and destroyed by even more advanced civilizations. By that account, we may be entering a particularly dangerous period, in which we have been broadcasting our presence but do not yet have the means to travel through space. 对费米悖论的不同回答会带来不同的挑战：更先进的文明可能已经变黑，以便不被更先进的文明发现和摧毁。按照这种说法，我们可能正在进入一个特别危险的时期，在这个时期，我们一直在广播我们的存在，但还没有办法在空间旅行。 Opportunities in the Knowledge Age 信息时代的机遇 Conversely, it is worth asking what kind of opportunities we might explore in the Knowledge Age. To begin with, there is a massive opportunity for automation. Fifty years or so after a successful transition to the Knowledge Age, I expect the amount of attention trapped in the job loop to have shrunk to around 20 percent or less of all human attention. This is comparable to the shrinkage of attention focused on agriculture during the Industrial Age. We will finally be able to achieve the level of freedom that many thinkers had previously predicted, such as Keynes in his essay “The Economic Possibilities for our Grandchildren,” where he wrote about humanity coming to enjoy a life of mostly leisure (Keynes, 1932). Even Marx envisioned such a world, although he believed it would be brought about differently. He wrote about a system that “makes it possible for me to do one thing today and another tomorrow, to hunt in the morning, fish in the afternoon, rear cattle in the evening, criticize after dinner, just as I have a mind, without ever becoming hunter, fisherman, herdsman or critic.” That is the promise of the Knowledge Age. 相反，值得一问的是，我们可以在信息时代探索什么样的机会。首先，有一个巨大的自动化机会。在成功过渡到信息时代的50年左右，我预计被困在工作循环中的注意力将缩减到所有人类注意力的20%左右或更少。这与工业时代专注于农业的注意力的缩减相当。我们将最终能够实现许多思想家之前预测的自由水平，例如凯恩斯在他的文章 \"我们孙子的经济可能性 \"中写道，人类将享受大部分休闲的生活（凯恩斯，1932）。甚至马克思也设想了这样一个世界，尽管他认为它将以不同的方式实现。他写到一个系统，\"使我有可能今天做一件事，明天做另一件事，早上打猎，下午捕鱼，晚上养牛，晚饭后批评，就像我有思想一样，而不会成为猎人、渔夫、牧民或批评家\"。这就是信息时代的承诺。 But there are many more opportunities for human progress, including space travel. One of the most depressing moments in my life came early on when I learned that at some point our sun will burn out and, in the process, annihilate all life on Earth. What is the point of anything we do if everything will come to an end anyhow? Thankfully I came to realize that with enough knowledge and progress, humanity could become a spacefaring species and live on other planets, before eventually traveling to the stars. 但是，人类还有许多进步的机会，包括太空旅行。我生命中最郁闷的时刻之一是在早期，我了解到在某个时刻我们的太阳会燃烧殆尽，在这个过程中，地球上的所有生命都会湮灭。如果一切都将结束，我们所做的一切又有什么意义呢？值得庆幸的是，我开始意识到，有了足够的知识和进步，人类可以成为一个航天物种，生活在其他星球上，最后再去星际旅行。 A third opportunity is the elimination of disease. It is sometimes easy to forget how far we have already come on that account. Many of the diseases that used to cripple or kill people have either become treatable or have been eliminated. We have started to make major progress in fighting cancer, and I believe there is a good chance that most cancers will become treatable within the next couple of decades. Ultimately this raises the question of mortality. Can, and should, we strive to become immortal? I believe we should, although achieving immortality will bring new problems. These are not the ones of overpopulation that some people imagine, as birth rates will be falling and there is, of course, space beyond our planet. The real challenge of immortality will be maintaining the functioning of the knowledge loop, as we will have to figure out not just how to keep the body alive but the mind flexible. Max Planck captured this challenge in his famous quote that “science advances one funeral at a time”—the older, dominant positions do not allow new theories to displace them. 第三个机会是消除疾病。有时很容易忘记我们在这方面已经取得了多大成就。许多曾经使人致残或致死的疾病，要么已经可以治疗，要么已经被消除了。我们已经开始在抗击癌症方面取得重大进展，而且我相信，在未来几十年内，大多数癌症都有可能变得可以治疗。归根结底，这提出了死亡率的问题。我们能否，以及是否应该努力成为不死之身？我相信我们应该，尽管实现永生会带来新的问题。这些问题不是一些人想象的人口过剩问题，因为出生率将下降，当然，我们的星球之外还有空间。长生不老的真正挑战将是维持知识循环的运作，因为我们不仅要弄清楚如何保持身体的活力，还要保持头脑的灵活性。马克斯-普朗克在他的名言中捕捉到了这一挑战，他说：\"科学每次都在一个葬礼上进步\"--旧的、主导的立场不允许新理论取代它们。 A fourth opportunity is to go from capital being merely sufficient to capital being abundant. By the definitions set out earlier, that would mean that the marginal cost of capital was zero. The best way to imagine what that might look like is to think of the replicator from Star Trek. Imagine a microwave oven that instead of heating up a dish makes it from scratch, without requiring you to shop for the ingredients first. Such an abundance of capital might seem a preposterous idea that could never be achieved, but for most physical assembly processes today, the factors that limit the rate are the energy required and the need for humans to operate parts of the system. Machine learning is helping with the second factor, but progress on energy has been slow: we don’t yet have any fusion reactors that output more energy than is used to start the fusion, but there is no fundamental reason that can’t be achieved. With enough knowledge we will make nuclear fusion work, removing the second major barrier to the abundance of capital. 第四个机会是，从资本仅仅充足到资本充足。根据前面的定义，这将意味着资本的边际成本为零。想象这种情况的最好方法是想到《星际迷航》中的复制器。想象一下一个微波炉，它不是加热一道菜，而是从头开始做，不需要你先去买材料。如此丰富的资本可能看起来是一个永远无法实现的荒谬想法，但对于今天的大多数物理组装过程，限制速度的因素是所需的能源和需要人类来操作系统的部分。机器学习正在帮助解决第二个因素，但能源方面的进展一直很缓慢：我们还没有任何核聚变反应堆输出的能量超过用于启动核聚变的能量，但没有根本原因不能实现。有了足够的知识，我们将使核聚变发挥作用，消除资本充裕的第二个主要障碍。 The Challenge Ahead 未来的挑战 We live in a period where there is an extraordinary range of possible outcomes for humanity. They include the annihilation of humankind in a climate catastrophe, at one extreme, and the indefinite exploration of the universe, at the other. Where we end up depends on the large and small choices each of us makes every day, from how we treat another person in conversation to how we tackle the climate crisis. It is a massive challenge, and I wake up every day both scared and excited about this moment of transition. I sincerely hope that The World After Capital makes a small contribution to getting us to the Knowledge Age. 我们生活在一个对人类来说有一系列非凡的可能结果的时期。它们包括人类在一场气候灾难中被消灭，这是一个极端，而另一个极端则是对宇宙的无限探索。我们的结局取决于我们每个人每天所做的大大小小的选择，从我们在谈话中如何对待另一个人到我们如何解决气候危机。这是一个巨大的挑战，我每天醒来时对这个过渡时刻既害怕又兴奋。我真诚地希望《资本后的世界》*能够为我们进入信息时代做出一点贡献。 "},"docs/Acknowledgments.html":{"url":"docs/Acknowledgments.html","title":"鸣谢","keywords":"","body":"鸣谢 I am grateful to all the people who have helped me along the way: my parents, who wholeheartedly supported my interest in computers, at a time when it was quite unusual and expensive to do so; my wife Susan Danziger and our children Michael, Katie and Peter, who make me a better person; my many teachers, including Erik Brynjolfsson and Bengt Holmström, from whom I learned so much; my partners at Union Square Ventures, starting with Fred Wilson and Brad Burnham who invited me to join the firm they had started; the many entrepreneurs I have had the opportunity to work with; the philosophers and scientists, such as David Deutsch and Chiara Marletto, who have demonstrated the power of human knowledge; the friends who have been there through good and bad times; and the many people who have taken the time to comment on the book and on my blog, who have invited me to speak, who have contributed in ways small and large, with special mentions for Ed Cooke for some of the earliest feedback, Seth Schulman for work on an early draft, Basil Vetas for capable research assistance, Nick Humphrey for goldilocks editing, Paul Reeves for intellectual pushback, Mona Alsubaei for perceptive feedback and crucial contributions to finishing the book, and Max Roser and the team at the Our World in Data project for their extensive data collection and visualization. 我很感谢所有在这一路上帮助过我的人： 我的父母，他们全心全意地支持我对计算机的兴趣，而当时这样做是很不寻常的，也很昂贵；我的妻子苏珊-丹齐格和我们的孩子迈克尔、凯蒂和彼得，他们使我成为一个更好的人；我的许多老师，包括埃里克-布林约尔松和本特-霍姆斯特伦，我从他们那里学到了很多； 我在Union Square Ventures的合伙人，从Fred Wilson和Brad Burnham开始，他们邀请我加入他们创办的公司；我有机会与之合作的许多企业家；哲学家和科学家，如David Deutsch和Chiara Marletto，他们证明了人类知识的力量； 经历过顺境和逆境的朋友们； 还有许多人花时间对这本书和我的博客发表评论，邀请我去演讲，他们做出了大大小小的贡献，特别要提到的是埃德-库克的一些最早的反馈，塞斯-舒尔曼对早期草案的工作，巴西尔-维塔斯的有力的研究协助、 Nick Humphrey的金手指编辑，Paul Reeves的智力反馈，Mona Alsubaei的敏锐反馈和对完成本书的重要贡献，以及Max Roser和Our World in Data项目的团队的大量数据收集和可视化。 "},"docs/Appendix.html":{"url":"docs/Appendix.html","title":"附录","keywords":"","body":"附录 The goal of this appendix is to provide additional data and arguments for why capital is sufficient, i.e. there is enough capital to meet everyone’s needs. Again, capital here specifically refers to physical capital, such as machines and infrastructure. It is physical capital, which produces the solutions to our needs, such as clothes and buildings. 本附录的目的是提供额外的数据和论据，说明为什么资本是充足的，即有足够的资本来满足每个人的需求。同样，这里的资本具体指的是物质资本，如机器和基础设施。正是物质资本，产生了满足我们需求的解决方案，如衣服和建筑。 There are three sections. The first section presents some general data on the development of global capital, showing the tremendous growth that has been accomplished over the last one hundred years. The second section uses data from World War II to show what can be accomplished when there is enough political will to redirect capital towards specific goals. Put differently, the bulk of capital available today is used in the service of wants, giving us a lot of room to meet needs. Finally, the third section dives deeper into each of the needs. 共分三节。第一部分介绍了一些关于全球资本发展的一般数据，显示了过去一百年来所完成的巨大增长。第二部分使用第二次世界大战的数据，显示当有足够的政治意愿将资本转向特定目标时，可以取得什么样的成就。换句话说，今天大部分可用的资本被用于服务于需求，给我们提供了很大的空间来满足需求。最后，第三部分深入探讨了每一项需求。 The Growth of Capital 资本的增长 It turns out to be surprisingly difficult to find global data on physical capital. The best source I have been able to locate is the World Bank, which publishes a data series on gross capital formation (World Bank, 2020c). Unfortunately the data here reaches back only to 1970 but it still shows an increase from roughly $5 trillion to $22 trillion in 2019 (this is measured on constant 2010 dollars, i.e. adjusted for inflation). 事实证明，要找到关于实物资本的全球数据是出乎意料的困难。我能够找到的最佳来源是世界银行，它发布了一个关于总资本形成的数据系列（世界银行，2020c）。不幸的是，这里的数据只能追溯到1970年，但它仍然显示从大约5万亿美元增加到2019年的22万亿美元（这是以2010年不变美元计算的，即根据通货膨胀调整）。 ​​ Gross Capital Source: World Bank, 2020c For triangulation it is worth considering the growth in output of some things that require productive capacity. We can infer the availability of physical capital through outputs. To that end, I was able to find the following chart of global crude steel production over time (Morfeldt, 2017). 为了进行三角测量，值得考虑一些需要生产能力的事物的产出增长。我们可以通过产出来推断实物资本的可用性。为此，我能够找到以下全球粗钢产量随时间变化的图表（Morfeldt, 2017）。 ​​ Steel Output Source: International Iron and Steel Institute 1991, 2001; Worldsteel Committee on Economic Studies, 2011; World Steel Association, 2021 Compared to gross capital there is only about a twofold growth here from 1970 to today, but it is important to keep in mind that during that time period we have come up with many materials other than steel from which to make things, such as aluminum and of course plastics. Importantly though this graph lets us compare steel output today with output at the time of World War II and we can see that there has been more than an order of magnitude growth (roughly 15x). 与总资本相比，从1970年到今天，这里只有大约2倍的增长，但重要的是要记住，在这段时间里，我们已经想出了许多钢铁以外的材料来制造东西，如铝，当然还有塑料。重要的是，这张图让我们将今天的钢铁产量与二战时的产量进行比较，我们可以看到，钢铁产量已经有了超过一个数量级的增长（大约15倍）。 What about finished goods production? This too is a good proxy for the amount of total available physical capital. A great example is the global production of cars. Here is a chart that shows it over time going back to the earliest days of the industry. 成品的生产情况如何？这也是可用实物资本总量的一个良好代表。一个很好的例子是汽车的全球生产。这里有一张图表，显示了它随着时间的推移，可以追溯到该行业最早的时期。 ​​ Car Production Source: Chamber of Commerce of the United States, 1973; Bureau of Transportation Statistics, 2017 Again we can see a roughly twofold increase relative to the 1970s and a greater than 10x increase if we go back further. This chart has an important feature worth pointing out now: there is a dip to near zero production in the mid 1940s corresponding to World War II. 我们可以再次看到相对于20世纪70年代有大约2倍的增长，如果我们再往前追溯，增长幅度超过10倍。这个图表有一个值得指出的重要特征：在1940年代中期，与第二次世界大战相对应的产量下降到接近零。 Here is a dramatic example of what all this productive capacity makes possible. The first commercially available handheld mobile phone was the Motorola DynaTAC 8000x which became available in 1984 (“Motorola DynaTAC,” 2021). Here is the growth of mobile phones since then, measured in active subscriptions (Statista, 2020). 这里有一个戏剧性的例子，说明所有这些生产能力使之成为可能。第一款商业化的手持移动电话是摩托罗拉DynaTAC 8000x，于1984年上市（\"摩托罗拉DynaTAC\"，2021）。以下是自那时以来移动电话的增长情况，以活跃用户数衡量（Statista，2020）。 ​​ Mobile Phone Subcriptions Source: Statista, 2020 Over the course of three decades we basically went from not having mobile phones to having more than the global population (this of course brings to mind William Gibson’s great quote that “[t]he future is already here – it’s just not evenly distributed” – with many people having two mobile phones, one for work and oner personal for example, while others have none). 在三十年的时间里，我们基本上从没有手机到拥有超过全球人口的手机（这当然让人想起威廉-吉布森的名言：\"未来已经到来--只是分布不均\" --许多人拥有两部手机，例如一部用于工作，一部用于个人，而其他人则没有）。 And here is one more example that’s highly relevant to the climate crisis: the rate at which we have produced solar panels (Statista, 2021a). 这里还有一个与气候危机高度相关的例子：我们生产太阳能板的速度（Statista，2021a）。 ​​ Solar Panel Output Source: Statista, 2021a Over a decade and a half we went from basically making no panels, to making 150 Gigawatts in new panels on what looks like an exponential growth trajectory. Now crucially we are currently using a small part of our productive capital to make solar panels. How do we know this? Because we have not yet taken the drastic steps necessary for fighting the climate crisis, which will eventually have to reach levels similar to the capital deployment in World War II. 在过去的十五年里，我们从基本上不生产电池板，到生产150吉瓦的新电池板，看起来是一个指数级的增长轨迹。现在至关重要的是，我们目前正在使用我们生产资本的一小部分来制造太阳能电池板。我们怎么知道的？因为我们还没有采取应对气候危机所需的严厉措施，这最终将不得不达到类似于第二次世界大战中资本部署的水平。 Capital Deployment in World War II 第二次世界大战中的资本部署 The prior section provided some data on how much physical capital has grown in the last one hundred years. When measured by certain proxies, such as the production of steel, it looks like about a 30x growth in capital over the last 100 years and a nearly 100x growth if one goes back just two decades further to 1900. We also saw that significant growth has occurred since World War II, which--as a first approximation--is at least an order of magnitude growth (10x). 前面的部分提供了一些数据，说明在过去的一百年里，物质资本增长了多少。如果用某些代用指标来衡量，如钢铁生产，在过去的100年里，资本似乎增长了30倍，如果再往前推20年，即1900年，增长了近100倍。我们还看到，自第二次世界大战以来，出现了显著的增长，这--作为一个第一近似值--至少是一个数量级的增长（10倍）。 Now someone might suggest that this growth could all be due to the population explosion, but that’s not the case. Over the same timeframe the global population has grown a lot less: from 1900 to today a bit less than 5x and from the end of World War II to today only by a bit more than 3x. Put differently, the increase in physical capital has far outstripped population growth (Our World in Data, 2019). 现在有人可能会提出，这种增长可能都是由于人口爆炸造成的，但事实并非如此。在相同的时间范围内，全球人口的增长要少得多：从1900年到今天不到5倍，从二战结束到今天只增加了3倍多一点。换句话说，物质资本的增长已经远远超过了人口的增长（《我们的数据世界》，2019年）。 Now one might still question whether this capital is sufficient to meet everyone’s needs, as I have asserted. Some of the strongest evidence for my claim comes from considering what happened during World War II. Here is a chart that shows the government share of GDP in the US during the war years (Casais, 2010). 现在，人们可能仍会质疑这种资本是否足以满足每个人的需求，正如我所断言的那样。我的主张的一些最有力的证据来自于考虑二战期间发生的事情。下面是一张图表，显示了战争年代美国政府在GDP中的份额（Casais，2010）。 Let’s dive a bit deeper and look at the manufacturing efforts. The US ramped production of tanks, airplanes, battleships and guns at an extraordinary clip in the war years. Here is a table that tabulates this for different weapons systems (Harrison, 1998). 让我们再深入一点，看看制造方面的努力。在战争年代，美国以惊人的速度提高了坦克、飞机、战舰和枪支的生产。这里有一个表格，列出了不同武器系统的生产情况（哈里森，1998）。 The numbers here are staggering. For example, in 1943 the US built 2654 major naval vessels. That’s more than 7 every day, or roughly one every three and half hours! In 1944 the US built over 74 thousand combat aircraft, that’s about 8.5 combat aircraft every hour. 这里的数字是惊人的。例如，在1943年，美国建造了2654艘主要海军舰艇。这意味着每天超过7艘，或者大约每三个半小时就有一艘! 在1944年，美国建造了超过7.4万架作战飞机，这大约是每小时8.5架作战飞机*。 We are not talking about simple devices here. These are complex high-performance systems with many components (think of the aircraft engines alone!). And that’s just the US production. There were similar scale efforts in Germany, Japan, the UK, and Russia. For example, adding up all the combat aircraft production in 1944 is 185 thousand units, which is 21 aircraft every hour. 我们在这里谈论的不是简单的设备。这些是复杂的高性能系统，有许多部件（想想飞机发动机就知道了！）。而这仅仅是美国的生产。在德国、日本、英国和俄罗斯也有类似规模的努力。例如，把1944年所有的作战飞机产量加起来是18.5万架，也就是每小时21架。 Now in the US while all of this production was happening, people were not starving, there was enough clothing, and were doing surprisingly well overall (Henderson, 2015). But as we saw earlier, the production of cars dropped dramatically — so how were people’s transportation needs met during this time? Through a massive increase in public transportation (Fetherston et al., n.d.). The connection was made quite explicitly with the government running ads “When you ride alone, you ride with Hitler.”(The U.S. National Archives and Records Administration, n.d.). This is a perfect illustration of separating a need, transportation, from its solutions, in this case individual versus shared mobility. 现在在美国，当所有这些生产发生时，人们没有挨饿，有足够的衣服，并且总体上做得出奇地好（亨德森，2015）。但正如我们前面所看到的，汽车的生产急剧下降--那么在这段时间里，人们的交通需求是如何得到满足的呢？通过大规模增加公共交通（Fetherston等人，n.d.）。政府的广告 \"当你独自乘坐时，你与希特勒一起乘坐\"（美国国家档案和记录管理局，n.d.），使这种联系变得相当明确。这是一个完美的例子，说明了将一个需求，即交通，与它的解决方案分开，在这种情况下，个人与共享流动性。 The continued ability to meet needs while at the same time repurposing half or more of physical capital strongly supports the claim of sufficient capital. As a first approximation much of that capital was previously used to meet wants. And it went back to meeting wants after World War II which partially explains the tremendous economic boom of the post war years. 继续满足需求的能力，同时重新利用一半或更多的实物资本，有力地支持了充足资本的说法。初步估计，这些资本中的大部分以前是用来满足需求的。二战后，这些资本又被用于满足需求，这部分解释了战后经济的巨大繁荣。 All of this is to say that today’s economy with at least an order of magnitude more capital than during World War II can easily meet our needs. Importantly it also means that we have plenty of additional capacity that could be allocated to solving the climate crisis. For example, we could dramatically ramp the production of everything from solar panels to nuclear reactors to heat pumps. 所有这些都是说，今天的经济拥有比二战时期至少多一个数量级的资本，可以轻松满足我们的需求。重要的是，这也意味着我们有大量的额外能力，可以分配给解决气候危机。例如，我们可以极大地提高从太阳能电池板到核反应堆到热泵的生产。 But there is more to be gleaned from what happened during World War II production. It isn’t just that we collectively made a lot of complicated stuff rapidly. We also innovated on extremely compressed time scales. The Manhattan project is the most obvious example of that which in a span of three years developed the nuclear bomb. It is hard to exaggerate how extensive this effort was, including for example uranium mining, as well as the exploration of several different bomb designs. 但从二战期间的生产情况中可以得到更多启示。这不仅仅是我们集体快速制造了许多复杂的东西。我们还在极度压缩的时间范围内进行了创新。曼哈顿项目是最明显的例子，它在三年的时间里开发了核弹。很难夸大这项工作有多么广泛，包括例如铀矿开采，以及对几种不同的炸弹设计的探索。 Important technologies were either invented or significantly advanced during World War II (Dickson, 2016). For example, at the beginning of the war, radar was a nascent technology. Towards the end of World War II through the invention of the cavity magnetron, the Allies managed to build radars small and lightweight enough to put on planes (“Cavity Magnetron,” 2021). Penicillin, which had been discovered in 1928, was not widely used until mass production was unlocked as part of a secretive World War II effort (“Penicillin,” 2021). 重要的技术要么是在二战期间发明的，要么是在二战期间取得重大进展的（Dickson，2016）。例如，在战争开始时，雷达是一项新生的技术。在二战接近尾声时，通过发明空腔磁控管，盟军成功地制造了小而轻的雷达，足以放在飞机上（\"空腔磁控管\"，2021）。1928年发现的青霉素，直到作为第二次世界大战秘密工作的一部分，大规模生产被解锁，才被广泛使用（\"青霉素\"，2021）。 Production and deployment at high volume also drove important improvements. Take fighter planes as an example. Early fighters had limited range which meant that bombers had to fly into enemy territory without escorts. Their only defense against local fighters were plane mounted machine guns. It was only as the war went on that escort fighters of sufficient range were developed to accompany bombers (“Escort Fighter,” 2021). This was made possible by a combination of technological advances, such as more powerful engines, and the insights gained from battle. 大批量的生产和部署也推动了重要的改进。以战斗机为例。早期战斗机的航程有限，这意味着轰炸机必须在没有护卫的情况下飞入敌方领土。他们对当地战斗机的唯一防御是飞机上的机枪。只是随着战争的进行，才开发出有足够航程的护航战斗机来陪伴轰炸机（\"护航战斗机\"，2021）。这是由技术进步，如更强大的发动机，以及从战斗中获得的洞察力共同促成的。 So what are the key takeaways? First, during peacetime mode much of the capital is used to meet wants not needs (the third installment in this post will look at this with regard to all the needs identified). Second, when switched into wartime mode, much of the productive capital can be redirected quickly towards accomplishing specific goals that are different from needs. This was already true at a much lower amount of physical capital per capita than is available today. Third, innovation can in fact be accelerated dramatically by focusing resources on critical problems. 那么，关键的启示是什么？首先，在和平时期，许多资本是用来满足需求的，而不是用来满足需要的（本文章的第三部分将针对所有已确定的需求来研究这个问题）。第二，当切换到战时模式时，许多生产性资本可以迅速被重新定向到完成不同于需求的特定目标上。在人均物质资本量远低于今天的情况下，这已经是事实。第三，通过将资源集中在关键问题上，事实上可以大大加速创新。 The obvious threat we are facing today that requires a massive reallocation of, and improvement in, capital is the climate crisis. Whether this can be accomplished is determined entirely by what we choose to pay attention to. Hence, the defining scarcity of our age is attention, not capital. 我们今天面临的明显的威胁，需要大规模重新分配和改善资本，就是气候危机。这是否能够实现，完全取决于我们选择关注什么。因此，我们这个时代的决定性匮乏是注意力，而不是资本。 Meeting Humanity’s Needs 满足人类的需求 The overall physical capital statistics provided earlier abstract away any regional differences. The examination of World War II showed that the US was able to meet people’s needs with a fraction of the available capital but obviously that wasn’t true elsewhere. In particular of course in the actual war zones much physical capital was destroyed, resulting in needs going unmet. In the following discussion too we will see that capital is not yet sufficient everywhere. Given the total amount of aggregate physical capital available now that is a distribution problem (which is really an attention scarcity problem). Paraphrasing a famous William Gibson quote: capital is already sufficient, it is just not yet evenly distributed. 前面提供的总体物质资本统计数字抽象了任何区域差异。对第二次世界大战的研究表明，美国能够用一小部分可用的资本来满足人们的需求，但显然其他地方不是这样的。当然，特别是在实际的战区，许多物质资本被摧毁，导致需求得不到满足。在下面的讨论中，我们也会看到，资本还不是到处都充足。鉴于现在可用的物质资本总量，这是一个分配问题（这实际上是一个注意力稀缺的问题）。套用威廉-吉布森的一句名言：资本已经足够了，只是还没有平均分配。 Furthermore I should caveat that I am providing a mix of statistics, anecdotes and arguments. My goal is not to make an incontrovertible case that capital is sufficient. I doubt this would be possible even with a lot more time, given the limited state of measurement of much of the world’s capital. Incidentally, I believe that eventually this paucity of data will be something humanity will look back in surprise, much as we sometimes wonder how things worked before we had mobile phones. Thankfully Max Roser, Hannah Ritchie, and the rest of the team at Our World in Data are starting to make a dent here. Instead, I am simply aiming to make a case that’s compelling enough to bolster the overall argument that attention has now become humanity’s critical scarcity. 此外，我应该警告，我提供的是统计数据、轶事和论据的组合。我的目标不是要提出一个无可争议的案例，说明资本是充足的。我怀疑即使有更多的时间也不可能做到这一点，因为对世界上许多资本的测量状况有限。顺便说一句，我相信最终这种数据的匮乏会让人类惊讶地回顾，就像我们有时会想，在我们拥有手机之前，事情是如何运作的。值得庆幸的是，马克斯-罗瑟、汉娜-里奇和 \"我们的数据世界 \"团队的其他成员正开始在这方面做出努力。相反，我只是想提出一个足够有说服力的案例，以支持整个论点，即注意力现在已经成为人类的关键稀缺物。 In the following the passage from the needs section is in italics, followed by an examination of the sufficiency of capital. I cover both individual and collective needs, as well as what I call enablers (e.g., energy). Along the way, I will also often point out how our lack of attention to the climate crisis and other problems may result in capital becoming scarce again in the future. 在下文中，需求部分的段落以斜体字显示，随后是对资本充足性的考察。我涵盖了个人和集体的需求，以及我所说的助推器（如能源）。一路上，我还会经常指出，我们对气候危机和其他问题缺乏关注，可能导致资本在未来再次变得稀缺。 Oxygen. On average, humans need about 550 liters of oxygen every day (“How Much Oxygen Does a Person Consume in a Day?,” 2000), depending on the size of our body and physical exertion. Our most common way of meeting this need is breathing air. Although that may sound obvious, we have developed other solutions through technology – for example, the blood of patients struggling to breathe can be oxygenated externally. 氧气。平均而言，人类每天需要大约550升的氧气（\"一个人一天要消耗多少氧气？\"，2000年），这取决于我们的身体大小和体力消耗。我们满足这一需求的最常见方式是呼吸空气。虽然这听起来很明显，但我们已经通过技术开发了其他解决方案--例如，挣扎着呼吸的病人的血液可以从外部获得氧气*。 There is no shortage of oxygen in the Earth’s atmosphere. Throughout industrialization the issue has been air pollution. For example, in London the air was so bad that the Great Smog of 1952 killed four thousand people in the span of less than a week (Smog Kills Thousands in England, 2020). More recently it has been Indian and Chinese cities that are experiencing similar levels of air pollution. This can definitely be seen as an example of a local insufficiency of capital. In the more developed countries the passage of clean air acts forced the installation of catalytic converters, a switch from coal to gas heat, etc. and largely resolved this deficiency. These same and even more advanced technologies (e.g. electric vehicles) can be deployed globally. China has already taken crucial steps in this direction, with the province of Hainan setting a 2030 deadline for all new and replacement vehicles to be emission free (Xue, 2019). 地球的大气层中并不缺乏氧气。在整个工业化过程中，问题是空气污染。例如，在伦敦，空气是如此糟糕，以至于1952年的大烟雾在不到一周的时间内杀死了四千人（烟雾在英国杀死了数千人，2020）。最近，是印度和中国的城市正在经历类似的空气污染水平。这绝对可以被看作是当地资本不足的一个例子。在较发达的国家，清洁空气法案的通过迫使人们安装催化转换器，从煤炭转向天然气加热等，并在很大程度上解决了这一不足。这些相同甚至更先进的技术（如电动汽车）可以在全球范围内部署。中国已经在这个方向上采取了关键步骤，海南省设定了2030年所有新的和替换的车辆都不排放的最后期限（薛，2019）。 We should, however, not take the earth’s atmosphere for granted. Many different phenomena resulted in the existence of and maintenance of today’s breathable atmosphere. For example, the Earth’s magnetic field protects it from the solar winds which would otherwise tear off large parts of the atmosphere (“Solar Wind,” 2021). A reduction in or even loss of the magnetic field is exactly the kind of long tail “Black Swan” type of event that we do not pay nearly enough attention to as humanity. 然而，我们不应认为地球的大气层是理所当然的。许多不同的现象导致了今天可呼吸大气层的存在和维持。例如，地球的磁场保护它不受太阳风的影响，否则太阳风会撕掉大气层的大部分（\"太阳风\"，2021年）。磁场的减少甚至消失，正是我们人类几乎没有足够重视的那种长尾 \"黑天鹅 \"类型的事件。 Water. We need to ingest two or three liters of water per day to stay hydrated, depending on factors such as body size, exertion and temperature. In addition to drinking water and fluids that contain it, we have other solutions for this, such as the water contained in the foods that we eat. 水。 我们每天需要摄取两到三升的水来保持水分，这取决于身体大小、体力消耗和温度等因素。除了喝水和含有水的液体外，我们还有其他解决办法，如我们吃的食物中含有的水。 As with oxygen, there is no shortage of water on Earth. The challenge is access to drinkable water which means sufficiently clean and desalinated water. Here too we can see how at an earlier point in development capital was insufficient. Again London serves as a great example: frequent Cholera outbreaks were the result of water wells that were not separated from sewage. John Snow famously documented the connection by establishing a detailed map in the 1854 outbreak which helped to overcome the prior “Miasma” theory of Cholera and ultimately resulted in London building out an elaborate water infrastructure (“1854 Broad Street Cholera Outbreak,” 2021). 与氧气一样，地球上并不缺乏水。面临的挑战是获得可饮用的水，也就是足够清洁和淡化的水。在这里我们也可以看到在发展的早期，资本是如何不足的。伦敦再次成为一个很好的例子：霍乱的频繁爆发是由于水井没有与污水分开。约翰-斯诺在1854年爆发的霍乱中通过建立详细的地图记录了这种联系，这有助于克服之前的霍乱 \"瘴气 \"理论，并最终导致伦敦建立了精心设计的水务基础设施（\"1854年布罗德街霍乱爆发\"，2021年）。 A more recent example is the water crisis in Flint, Michigan where lead from old pipes resulted in toxic drinking water (“Flint Water Crisis,” 2021). So we can see how capital has been insufficient here and is still insufficient in some parts of the world but not because of some fundamental lack of technology or capital but rather because of a failure of attention to clean water access. The World Bank has come up with an estimate of only about $28 billion annually to provide everyone in the world with basic water, sanitation and hygiene, and about $114 billion to make these services available continuously (Hutton, 2016). These surprisingly low numbers show how little physical capital would need to be deployed. Clean drinking water is a great example of the type of problem where markets tend to fail and hence attention allocation needs to happen through other processes (e.g. by electing a capable city government). 最近的一个例子是密歇根州弗林特的水危机，旧管道的铅导致了有毒的饮用水（\"弗林特水危机\"，2021）。因此，我们可以看到资本在这里是如何不足的，而且在世界的一些地方仍然不足，但不是因为一些根本性的技术或资本的缺乏，而是因为没有注意到清洁水的获取。世界银行得出的估计是，每年只有约280亿美元为世界上的每个人提供基本的水、环境卫生和个人卫生，约1140亿美元使这些服务持续提供（Hutton，2016）。这些令人惊讶的低数字表明需要部署的物质资本是多么的少。清洁饮用水是一个很好的例子，说明市场往往会失败，因此需要通过其他过程（例如，通过选举一个有能力的城市政府）来分配注意力的问题。 Calories. To power our bodies, adults need between 1,500 and 3,200 calories per day (U.S. Department of Agriculture and U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2015), a need we mainly meet by eating and drinking. The best way to obtain calories, however, is surprisingly poorly understood – the mix between proteins, lipids and carbohydrates is subject to debate. 卡路里。为了给我们的身体提供动力，成年人每天需要1500至3200卡路里（美国农业部和美国卫生与公众服务部，2015年），我们主要通过吃喝来满足这一需求。然而，获得卡路里的最佳方式令人惊讶地不太了解--蛋白质、脂类和碳水化合物之间的混合是有争议的*。 Eating food is the primary solution to our need for calories. This is where Malthus expected the big shortfall to come from. Agriculture simply wouldn’t be able to keep up with the growth in population. The big breakthrough that he didn’t anticipate was the Haber Bosch process of nitrogen fixation, which powered the so-called green revolution. Equipped with artificial nitrogen fertilizer, agricultural output soared. 吃食物是解决我们对卡路里需求的主要办法。这就是马尔萨斯预期的巨大缺口的来源。农业根本无法跟上人口增长的步伐。他没有预料到的重大突破是哈伯博世的固氮过程，它为所谓的绿色革命提供了动力。有了人工氮肥的装备，农业产量猛增。 The other big win in agriculture was the use of machinery. Today in the US only 1.3% of the employed population works in agriculture and the entire food supply system at $1.1 trillion represents only 5% of total GDP (Lepley, 2019; USDA, n.d.). Even in countries that are further back in development such as India, the percentage of the population engaged in farming has been shrinking, a decline made possible by the availability of sufficient physical capital (Shrinivasan, 2013). 农业的另一个大赢家是机械的使用。今天在美国，只有1.3%的就业人口从事农业，整个食品供应系统的1.1万亿美元只占GDP总量的5%（Lepley，2019；USDA，n.d.）。即使在发展较落后的国家，如印度，从事农业的人口比例也一直在萎缩，这种下降是由于有足够的物质资本（Shrinivasan，2013）。 Now clearly not everyone has access to enough calories to meet their needs. For example, starvation is ravaging Yemen right now as a result of the ongoing war there. Overall, however, since the 1970s the incidence of death from famine has been at historic lows (Hasell, 2013). And even before that as Amartya Sen and others have documented many famines resulted from a failure to distribute food, not an absolute lack of it (with examples of rotting supplies in harbors while people starve nearby). 现在显然不是每个人都能获得足够的卡路里来满足他们的需求。例如，由于也门正在发生的战争，饥饿正在肆虐。然而，总体而言，自20世纪70年代以来，饥荒死亡的发生率一直处于历史低位（Hasell，2013）。甚至在此之前，正如阿玛蒂亚-森和其他人所记录的那样，许多饥荒是由于未能分配食物，而不是绝对缺乏食物（有例子表明，港口的物资腐烂，而附近的人挨饿）。 Here too though we cannot rest on our accomplishments. The biggest risk to humanity’s ability to meet everyone’s need for calories is the climate crisis which is disrupting the relatively stable weather patterns required by agriculture. So far we have been experiencing crop failures only locally and sometimes regionally. A global large scale crop failure would result in starvation as we have very limited stockpiles. 但在这方面我们也不能满足于我们的成就。人类满足每个人的热量需求的能力所面临的最大风险是气候危机，它正在破坏农业所需的相对稳定的天气模式。到目前为止，我们只是在局部地区，有时是区域性地经历了作物歉收。全球大规模的作物歉收将导致饥饿，因为我们的库存非常有限。 Nutrients. The body cannot synthesize all the materials it requires, including a couple of certain fatty acids, some amino acids, as well as a few vitamins and minerals – these are called “essential” and must be obtained as part of our nutrition. This is another area that is surprisingly poorly understood, meaning that the actual mix and amount of required nutrients we need to take in seems unsettled. 营养素。身体无法合成它所需要的所有材料，包括一些特定的脂肪酸、一些氨基酸，以及一些维生素和矿物质--这些被称为 \"必需品\"，必须作为我们营养的一部分获得。这是另一个令人惊讶的理解不足的领域，这意味着我们需要摄入的所需营养物质的实际组合和数量似乎尚未确定。 Nutrients, while important, are needed in relatively small amounts. For example, the daily recommended amount for alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) is between 0.5g and 1.6g (National Institutes of Health, 2021). The biggest intake requirements are the essential amino acids, with adults probably needing about 7g daily of Leucine as one example (Appleby, 2018). For minerals and vitamins we are talking about even smaller amounts. These are mostly in the milligram and microgram range with the exception of Calcium, Chloride and Sodium, which are needed in a few grams each (Romine, 2019). 营养物质虽然重要，但需要的量相对较少。例如，α-亚麻酸（ALA）的每日推荐量在0.5克至1.6克之间（National Institutes of Health, 2021）。摄入量要求最大的是必需氨基酸，以成年人为例，每天可能需要约7克亮氨酸（Appleby, 2018）。对于矿物质和维生素，我们谈论的是更小的数量。这些大多是毫克和微克的范围，但钙、氯化物和钠除外，它们各需要几克（Romine，2019）。 The cost and capital required to produce all of these essential nutrients has been declining substantially over time as a result of scientific and engineering progress. For example, we have recently figured out how to grow rice that has more Vitamin A in it, called Golden Rice (Dubock, 2019). More than half the global population eats rice daily and so having it deliver enough Vitamin A is a major way of ensuring sufficient amounts of that essential nutrient are available. 由于科学和工程的进步，生产所有这些基本营养物质所需的成本和资本随着时间的推移而大幅下降。例如，我们最近想出了如何种植含有更多维生素A的大米，称为黄金大米（Dubock, 2019）。全球一半以上的人口每天都要吃大米，因此让大米提供足够的维生素A是确保提供足够数量的这种基本营养素的一个主要途径。 Here too, capital is not the binding constraint today. But as the example of Golden Rice shows, it will continue to be important to innovate so as to better meet nutrient needs for everyone and not just those who can currently afford to buy every possible supplement by walking into the nearest drug store. Further research is also required to understand which nutrients we really need and in what dosage for humans to thrive and live long, healthy lives. 在这里，资本也不是今天的约束性制约因素。但是，正如黄金大米的例子所显示的，创新将继续是重要的，以便更好地满足每个人的营养需求，而不仅仅是那些目前有能力通过走进最近的药店购买各种可能的补充剂的人。还需要进一步研究，以了解我们真正需要哪些营养物质，以及人类需要多少剂量才能茁壮成长和健康生活。 Discharge. We also need to get things out of our bodies by expelling processed food, radiating heat and exhaling carbon dioxide. Humans have made a great deal of progress around meeting our discharge needs, such as toilets and public sanitation. 排泄。我们还需要通过排出加工过的食物、散发热量和呼出二氧化碳来把东西排出体外。人类已经在满足我们的排放需求方面取得了很大的进展，如厕所和公共卫生设施*。 Building public sanitation systems is one of the major contributors to improvements in life expectancy. As Steven Johnson documents in his books “The Ghost Map” (2007) and “Extra Life” (2021) the city of London was hit by repeated Cholera outbreaks until it separated sewage from fresh water delivery. Even back in the mid 1800s London had sufficient capital to build out a large scale sewer system (“London Sewerage System,” 2021). 建设公共卫生系统是改善预期寿命的主要贡献者之一。正如史蒂文-约翰逊在他的书《幽灵地图》（2007年）和《额外的生命》（2021年）中所记录的那样，伦敦市被反复的霍乱袭击，直到它将污水与淡水输送分开。甚至早在19世纪中期，伦敦就有足够的资金来建立一个大规模的下水道系统（\"伦敦下水道系统\"，2021年）。 In many countries we take this for granted today but there are still places in the world that have insufficient sewage treatment capacity. Globally the number of people without access to proper sanitation has been declining albeit slowly (Ritchie & Roser, 2021). That’s largely due to the fact that a lack of sanitation exists predominantly in the places with the highest population growth. Still at this point about two thirds of the global population has access to sanitation and the total number of people who do has grown by several billion in the last couple of decades. This has been possible as the overall capital required for achieving sufficient sanitation is relatively low and again has been declining with technological progress (García , 2009). 在许多国家，我们今天认为这是理所当然的，但世界上仍有一些地方的污水处理能力不足。在全球范围内，无法获得适当卫生设施的人数一直在下降，尽管速度很慢（Ritchie & Roser, 2021）。这主要是由于缺乏卫生设施的情况主要存在于人口增长最快的地方。目前，全球仍有约三分之二的人口可以使用卫生设施，在过去几十年里，使用卫生设施的总人数增加了几十亿。这是有可能的，因为实现足够的卫生设施所需的总体资本相对较低，而且随着技术的进步而不断下降（García，2009）。 Sanitation provides another example of how a lack of attention to the right problems puts our ability to meet our needs at risk. Right here in New York City for example during heavy downpours raw sewage spills into the East and Hudson Rivers because of insufficient capacity in the rainwater runoff systems (Chaisson, 2017). With the climate crisis accelerating, the frequency of that kind of heavy rainfall is increasing rapidly (Climate Central, 2019). 卫生设施提供了另一个例子，说明缺乏对正确问题的关注会使我们满足需求的能力受到威胁。以纽约市为例，在大雨期间，由于雨水径流系统的容量不足，原污水溢出到东河和哈德逊河（Chaisson，2017）。随着气候危机的加速，这种强降雨的频率正在迅速增加（气候中心，2019）。 Temperature. Our bodies can self-regulate their temperature, but only within a limited range of environmental temperature and humidity. Humans can easily freeze to death or die of overheating (we cool our bodies through sweating, also known as ‘evaporative cooling’, which stops working when the air gets too hot and humid). We therefore often need to help our bodies with temperature regulation by controlling our environment. Common strategies to meet our temperature needs include clothing, shelter, heating and air conditioning. 温度。 *我们的身体可以自我调节温度，但只能在有限的环境温度和湿度范围内进行调节。人类很容易被冻死或死于过热（我们通过出汗来冷却身体，也被称为 \"蒸发冷却\"，当空气变得太热和太潮湿时，这种冷却就会停止）。因此，我们经常需要通过控制环境来帮助我们的身体进行温度调节。满足我们温度需求的常见策略包括衣服、住所、暖气和空调。 We have long had enough capital to provide everyone in the world with clothing. We are strictly faced with a distribution problem here. Some people don’t have the financial resources or live in circumstances, such as homelessness, that make it difficult for them to acquire and maintain sufficient clothing. Conversely in many advanced economies people have piles of unused clothes and the so-called fast fashion industry promotes rapid changes in style that result in massive additional consumption. 我们早就有足够的资本为世界上的每个人提供衣服。我们在这里严格面临着一个分配问题。有些人没有经济来源，或生活在无家可归等环境中，使他们难以获得和维持足够的衣服。相反，在许多发达经济体中，人们有成堆的闲置衣服，而所谓的快速时尚产业促进了风格的快速变化，导致了大量的额外消费。 But what about shelter? This is a more difficult problem that requires significantly more capital. Here too the evidence suggests that we have sufficient physical capital. For example it is estimated that in 2015 we already had over 220 billion square meters of buildings globally (UNEP & GABC, 2017). This amounts to 30 square meters per person. Now of course some part of that is commercial and industrial space, still this shows that as a first approximation we can house everyone. Even more impressive is the rate at which we are adding space. The same report estimates that by 2030 we will be at over 300 billion square meters of buildings. We also have a lot of circumstantial evidence that supports this conclusion. In particular building booms in various parts of the world, including China, the US and the Middle East, created vast local oversupplies of housing. For instance at the height of the China boom enough housing was added annually for the equivalent of two new ten million resident cities (Slotta, 2020). 但是避难所呢？这是一个更困难的问题，需要更多的资本。这里也有证据表明，我们有足够的物质资本。例如，据估计，2015年我们在全球已经有超过2200亿平方米的建筑（UNEP和GABC，2017）。这相当于每个人有30平方米。当然，其中有一部分是商业和工业空间，但这仍然表明，作为一个初步的近似值，我们可以容纳所有人。更令人印象深刻的是，我们正在增加空间的速度。同一报告估计，到2030年，我们的建筑将超过3000亿平方米。我们也有很多间接的证据支持这一结论。特别是世界各地的建筑热潮，包括中国、美国和中东地区，造成了当地大量的住房供应过剩。例如，在中国的繁荣时期，每年增加的住房相当于两个新的1000万居民的城市（Slotta, 2020）。 And yet again we encounter the climate crisis as the biggest threat to our ability to provide adequate shelter to everyone. In the US alone, nearly 15 million housing units are threatened by floods as found by a recently updated federal mapping exercise (Kaufman et al., 2020). That doesn’t count homes threatened by forest fires. Over longer time horizons sea level rise will make large coastal areas around the world uninhabitable. We are already experiencing significant climate refugee movements today. In 2020 alone it is estimated that 30 million people were displaced globally due to storms and floods (Global Migration Data Portal, 2021). The forecasts are that by 2050 as many as 1 billion people may need shelter in a new location (Kamal, 2017). 而我们又一次遇到了气候危机，它是对我们为每个人提供适当住房能力的最大威胁。仅在美国，就有近1500万套住房受到洪水的威胁，这是最近更新的联邦测绘工作发现的（Kaufman等人，2020）。这还不算受到森林火灾威胁的房屋。在更长的时间范围内，海平面上升将使世界各地的大型沿海地区无法居住。我们今天已经在经历重大的气候难民流动。仅在2020年，估计全球就有3000万人因风暴和洪水而流离失所（全球移民数据门户，2021年）。预测到2050年，可能有多达10亿人需要在新的地方避难（Kamal, 2017）。 Can we heat and cool all this space as needed? The capital requirements here are accelerating rapidly at the moment due to the unfolding climate crisis which is increasing cooling requirements globally. This is not just a question of convenience. In hot and humid conditions evaporative cooling via sweat stops working and when that happens people die from overheating. This is now a routine occurrence in many parts of the world and even a relatively northern region such as Europe is affected, with the 2019 heat wave causing over two thousand deaths (Borunda, 2021; “2019 European Heat Waves,” 2021). 我们能否根据需要对所有这些空间进行加热和冷却？由于正在展开的气候危机在全球范围内增加了冷却要求，这里的资本要求目前正在迅速加快。这不仅仅是一个方便的问题。在炎热和潮湿的条件下，通过汗水的蒸发冷却停止工作，当这种情况发生时，人们会因过热而死亡。这在世界许多地方现在已经是家常便饭，甚至像欧洲这样相对较北的地区也受到影响，2019年的热浪导致超过两千人死亡（Borunda，2021；\"2019年欧洲热浪\"，2021）。 As of 2020 there are an estimated 1.9 billion AC units in the world, adding about 110 million units annually at an accelerating pace (Armstrong, 2020; Holst, 2020). The key constraint here is not capital but electricity to run all of these new units, which will be further exacerbated by the need to switch heating from fossil fuels to electricity. This constraint will be looked at in the energy section further down. 截至2020年，世界上估计有19亿台空调，每年约增加1.1亿台，而且速度加快（Armstrong，2020；Holst，2020）。这里的关键制约因素不是资本，而是运行所有这些新设备的电力，这将因需要将加热从化石燃料转向电力而进一步加剧。这一制约因素将在下面的能源章节中进行探讨。 Pressure. Anybody who has gone diving will be aware that our bodies do not handle increased pressure very well. The same goes for decreased pressure, which is one of the reasons why we find air travel exhausting (airplane cabins maintain pressure similar to being at the top of an eight-thousand-foot mountain). 压力。任何去过潜水的人都会知道，我们的身体不能很好地处理增加的压力。压力降低也是如此，这也是我们发现航空旅行令人疲惫的原因之一（飞机舱内的压力类似于在八千英尺的山顶）。 Thankfully we need minimal capital to meet our pressure needs. One might at first assume that we do not need any capital, but that’s not correct. For example, pretty much all commercial flights are in altitudes that require pressurized cabins and hence extra capital above and beyond what would be required for an unpressurized plane. For instance, at just 12 km of altitude pressure falls to 0.2 bar (“Cabin Pressurization,” 2021). At such a low pressure it is not just a lack of oxygen that would be fatal, but also decompression sickness may occur where gases that have been dissolved in the bloodstream may gas out resulting in sickness and even death. As noted earlier, we cannot take the existence of the Earth’s atmosphere for granted. So in addition to giving thought on how to create a livable atmosphere on planets such as Mars that we may eventually want to settle, we need to pay attention to the various forces that could damage or even destroy the Earth’s atmosphere. 值得庆幸的是，我们需要最少的资本来满足我们的压力需求。人们可能一开始就认为我们不需要任何资本，但这是不正确的。例如，几乎所有的商业飞行都在需要加压舱的高度，因此需要超出非加压飞机所需的额外资本。例如，在仅仅12公里的高度，压力下降到0.2巴（\"机舱增压\"，2021年）。在如此低的压力下，不仅仅是缺氧会致命，而且还可能发生减压病，溶解在血液中的气体可能会排出，导致疾病甚至死亡。如前所述，我们不能把地球大气层的存在视为理所当然。因此，除了考虑如何在我们最终可能想要定居的火星等星球上创造一个宜居的大气层之外，我们还需要注意可能损害甚至破坏地球大气层的各种力量。 Light. Most humans would be hard-pressed to achieve much in complete darkness. For a long time, our need for light was met mainly by sunlight, but much human ingenuity has gone into the creation of artificial light sources. 光。 *大多数人在完全黑暗的环境中很难取得什么成就。长期以来，我们对光的需求主要由阳光来满足，但人类在创造人工光源方面有很大的智慧。 Our ability to make artificial light is one of the great human achievements and also a story of ongoing progress. We are the only species that has the knowledge to make fire, a capability attributed in Greek mythology to Prometheus who stole fire from the gods. Capital is essential to making light, from the earliest time of gathering wood to the modern creation of light emitting diodes (LEDs). This progress has meant that light has become incredibly affordable in most parts of the world and consumption has gone up accordingly (for example, in the UK by four orders of magnitude over the last two hundred years) (Roser, 2013). Even in extremely poor countries that lack electrical infrastructure, so-called “offgrid solar” is revolutionizing the availability of light, replacing the burning of kerosene and other dangerous fuels. In summary we are definitely not constrained by capital when it comes to our need for light. 我们制造人造光的能力是人类的伟大成就之一，也是一个不断进步的故事。我们是唯一拥有制造火的知识的物种，这种能力在希腊神话中被认为是普罗米修斯从众神那里偷来的火。资本对于制造光是必不可少的，从最早的收集木材到现代的发光二极管（LED）的创造。这种进步意味着，在世界大多数地区，光已经变得令人难以置信地负担得起，消费也相应地上升（例如，在英国，在过去的两百年里，消费上升了四个数量级）（Roser, 2013）。即使在缺乏电力基础设施的极端贫困国家，所谓的 \"离网太阳能 \"正在彻底改变照明的可用性，取代了煤油和其他危险燃料的燃烧。总之，在我们对光的需求方面，我们绝对不会受到资本的限制。 Healing. Whenever we damage our body, it needs to heal. The human body comes equipped with extensive systems for self-healing, but beyond a certain range it needs external assistance. We have developed many solutions, which are often grouped under the term ‘healthcare’. 愈合。 *当我们损害身体时，它需要愈合。人体配备了大量的自我修复系统，但超过一定范围就需要外部援助。我们已经开发了许多解决方案，这些解决方案通常被归入 \"保健 \"一词。 The primary constraint on healing has been knowledge, rather than capital. As documented in Steven Johnson’s book Extra Life, for the longest time medical interventions tended to result in worse outcomes as doctors had no idea what they were doing (Johnson, 2021). Conversely, today it has become possible to create new life saving medicines virtually overnight, as was the case with the COVID-19 mRNA vaccines. These are super cheap to manufacture and supply has been held back by artificial limitations based primarily on intellectual property protection rather than a scarcity of capital. 对治疗的主要制约因素是知识，而不是资本。正如史蒂文-约翰逊的《额外的生命》一书中所记载的那样，在很长一段时间里，医疗干预往往会导致更糟糕的结果，因为医生不知道他们在做什么（约翰逊，2021）。相反，今天已经有可能几乎在一夜之间创造出新的救命药物，就像COVID-19 mRNA疫苗那样。这些药物的制造成本超低，而供应却被主要基于知识产权保护而非资本稀缺的人为限制所制约。 It is als crucial to understand that much of our current need for healing could be avoided in the first place by leading healthier lives. As noted earlier we do not know as much about nutrition as we should, but we do know that obesity contributes significantly to medical problems and yet the rate of obesity has increased dramatically, especially in the United States. Similarly we do know that stress is negatively associated with health and yet the stress level for many people has gone up for a range of reasons from economic insecurity to proliferation of stress inducing online content. Overall, the bulk of medical expenses today is accounted for by chronic conditions, such as diabetes (CDC, n.d.). 了解我们目前对治疗的大部分需求首先可以通过更健康的生活来避免，这也是至关重要的。如前所述，我们对营养的了解并不像我们应该了解的那样多，但我们确实知道肥胖对医疗问题的贡献很大，但肥胖率却急剧上升，尤其是在美国。同样，我们知道压力与健康有负面关系，但许多人的压力水平由于一系列原因而上升，从经济不安全到诱发压力的在线内容的扩散。总的来说，今天医疗费用的大部分是由慢性病引起的，如糖尿病（CDC，n.d.）。 Despite all of this we can measure our tremendous progress on healing by considering the increase in life expectancy (Roser, 2019b). Based on historical data, life expectancy in 1800 was well below 40 years across the entire world. By 2015 it had risen to well over 70 years in many places and to over 80 in some. Even in Africa, which is the furthest behind, life expectancy in many countries in the 60s. 尽管这样，我们可以通过考虑预期寿命的增加来衡量我们在治疗方面的巨大进步（Roser，2019b）。根据历史数据，1800年整个世界的预期寿命远低于40岁。到2015年，它在许多地方已经上升到远远超过70岁，在一些地方超过80岁。即使在落后最远的非洲，许多国家的预期寿命也在60岁以上。 That of course doesn’t mean we can’t face a great reversal. Covid provided a glimpse of what that might look like. As does the decrease in life expectancy in the United States due to what has been termed “deaths of despair” by Anne Case and Angus Deaton, which have impacted many groups, but particularly white middle-aged males (Case & Deaton, 2021). Finally again the climate crisis looms large here with deaths from heat waves, crop failure, etc. having the potential to undo much of the progress we have made. 当然，这并不意味着我们不能面临大逆转。科维德提供了一个可能是这样的一瞥。正如安妮-凯斯和安格斯-迪顿所说的由于 \"绝望的死亡 \"而导致的美国预期寿命的减少，这影响了许多群体，但特别是白人中年男性（凯斯和迪顿，2021）。最后，气候危机在这里再次出现，热浪、农作物歉收等造成的死亡有可能使我们已经取得的大部分进展付诸东流。 Learning. When we are born, we are quite incompetent – we have to learn basic skills, such as walking and how to use even the simplest tools. When we encounter a new situation, we have to learn how to deal with it. We group many of the strategies for meeting the need for learning under the heading ‘education’, but other solutions include experimenting to gain experience, self-study and parenting. 学习。当我们出生时，我们是相当无能的--我们必须学习基本技能，如走路和如何使用甚至最简单的工具。当我们遇到一个新情况时，我们必须学习如何处理它。我们将许多满足学习需求的策略归入 \"教育 \"的标题下，但其他解决方案包括通过实验来获得经验、自学和教养。 There has been tremendous progress in making learning available to everyone around the world. A crucial enabler of learning is literacy and that has grown tremendously over the last two hundred years. In the early 1800s fewer than 20% of people globally were literate (Our World in Data, n.d.). Today global literacy is approaching 90%. 在使世界各地的人都能获得学习机会方面，已经取得了巨大的进展。学习的一个关键因素是识字，在过去的两百年里，识字率有了极大的提高。在19世纪初，全球只有不到20%的人识字（《我们的数据世界》，n.d.）。今天，全球识字率已接近90%。 It is crucial to recognize that traditional schools are only one solution to the need for learning. It is a capital intensive one as it requires the construction of buildings. There are many alternative solutions such as unschooling, homeschooling, and neighborhood schools. 关键是要认识到，传统学校只是解决学习需求的一个办法。它是一个资本密集型的解决方案，因为它需要建造建筑物。有许多替代解决方案，如非学校教育、家庭教育和社区学校。 Increasingly pretty much all the world’s knowledge can be delivered via a smartphone. Global smartphone penetration is approaching 80% (O’Dea, 2021). Even in relatively poor countries smartphones are becoming much more widespread. For example a new Android phone can be purchased in India for 7,000 Rupees (~$100) and smartphone penetration there has reached 42% in 2020 (91 (Mobile Price List In India, n.d.; Statista, 2021b). 越来越多的世界上的几乎所有知识都可以通过智能手机来传递。全球智能手机的渗透率已接近80%（O'Dea，2021）。即使在相对贫穷的国家，智能手机也变得更加普遍。例如，在印度，一部新的安卓手机只需7000卢比（约100美元）就可以买到，2020年那里的智能手机普及率已经达到42%（91（Mobile Price List In India, n.d.; Statista, 2021b）。 Now the assertion that anything can be learned via a smartphone may seem preposterous. But research on so-called “minimally invasive education” and “unschooling” has shown that children want to learn and are capable of learning largely independently when given the right opportunity (“Minimally Invasive Education,” 2021; “Unschooling,” 2021). Even some famous scientists, including notably Einstein and Faraday, did a great deal of independent studying early on, with the latter having virtually no formal education (“Albert Einstein,” 2021; “Michael Faraday,” 2021). 现在，通过智能手机就能学到任何东西的断言可能看起来很荒唐。但是关于所谓的 \"微创教育 \"和 \"非学校教育 \"的研究表明，如果有合适的机会，孩子们想要学习，并且能够在很大程度上独立学习（\"微创教育\"，2021；\"非学校教育\"，2021）。甚至一些著名的科学家，主要包括爱因斯坦和法拉第，也在早期做了大量的独立学习，后者几乎没有接受过正规教育（\"阿尔伯特-爱因斯坦\"，2021年；\"迈克尔-法拉第\"，2021年）。 Meaning. As humans, we have a profound psychological need for meaning in our lives. One solution is to have a purpose. Religious belief and belonging to a community have long been a source of purpose for humans. Another key strategy comes from our interactions with other humans, including having other people acknowledge our contributions to a project, or even merely recognize our existence. 意义。作为人类，我们对生活的意义有着深刻的心理需求。一个解决方案就是要有一个目的。长期以来，宗教信仰和对社区的归属一直是人类目的的来源。另一个关键的策略来自于我们与其他人类的互动，包括让其他人承认我们对某个项目的贡献，甚至只是承认我们的存在。 As stated in the main text, the need for meaning can be met more or less without capital. Meaning comes from stories, beliefs, recognition and many other sources, none of which have any substantial capital requirements. These have existed in oral form long before humans developed written language. 正如正文中所说，对意义的需求或多或少可以在没有资本的情况下得到满足。意义来自于故事、信仰、认可和许多其他来源，这些都没有任何实质性的资本要求。早在人类发展出书面语言之前，这些就已经以口头形式存在了。 Reproduction. Individuals can survive without sex, but reproduction is a need for societies as a whole. We have learned how to reproduce without sex; in the future, there may be different solutions for the continuation of a human society – whether here on Earth or elsewhere. 生殖。个人可以在没有性的情况下生存，但生殖是整个社会的需要。我们已经学会了如何在没有性的情况下进行繁殖；在未来，可能会有不同的解决方案来延续一个人类社会--无论是在地球上还是在其他地方。 Historically we have needed no capital for reproduction. Ironically that is changing as sperm count and motility are dropping in many places around the world (likely due to many products containing hormone disrupting chemicals) (Chiu, 2021). So eventually we may need to use technological means for reproduction. These could over the long term also involve the creation of artificial wombs, something that’s already possible for animals (Becker, 2017). 历史上，我们不需要资本来进行繁殖。具有讽刺意味的是，这种情况正在发生变化，因为世界上许多地方的精子数量和活力都在下降（可能是由于许多产品含有干扰荷尔蒙的化学物质）（Chiu, 2021）。因此，最终我们可能需要使用技术手段进行繁殖。从长远来看，这些也可能涉及到人造子宫的创造，这对动物来说已经是可能的了（Becker, 2017）。 Allocation. Access to physical resources has to be allocated. Take a chair as an example. Only one person can comfortably sit in it at a time – when there are multiple people, we need a way of allocating the chair between them. If you are by yourself, you can sit on a chair whenever you want to – allocation is a collective need. 分配。 *对物理资源的访问必须进行分配。以一把椅子为例。一次只能有一个人舒服地坐在上面--当有多个人的时候，我们需要一种在他们之间分配椅子的方法。如果你是一个人，你可以随时坐在椅子上--分配是一种集体需要。 The need for allocation is more severe the less of something there is. For example, in the early days of producing the COVID vaccine, when there were few doses, there were intense debates about how to allocate the available doses. With enough progress we can envision a world with dramatically reduced allocation needs, where we can always make more of something on the spot whenever we need it. I believe we are a long way out from abundance in the physical realm. Even in Star Trek, which is often seen as a fictional model of abundance with technology such as the replicator, there are often allocation needs, such as the captain having to decide whether to route power to the shields or the weapons or the engines. It is easy to think of other examples where we will still have an allocation mechanism, such as going to see the original Mona Lisa at the Louvre -- only so many people can fit in the room at any one time. In the extreme of course some will argue that it might become possible to give you a Matrix style experience where you think you are in the room at the Louvre with the Mona Lisa but in fact have never left your home. While possible in principle I again believe this is a long way off. 东西越少，对分配的需求就越严重。例如，在生产COVID疫苗的早期，当剂量很少时，人们对如何分配现有的剂量进行了激烈的辩论。如果有足够的进展，我们可以设想一个大幅减少分配需求的世界，在那里我们总是可以在需要的时候当场制造更多的东西。我相信我们离物质领域的丰富性还有很远的距离。即使在《星际迷航》中，它也经常被看作是一个拥有复制器等技术的丰富模型，也经常有分配需求，例如船长必须决定是否将能量输送到防护罩、武器或引擎。我们很容易想到其他的例子，在这些例子中，我们仍然会有一个分配机制，比如去卢浮宫看蒙娜丽莎的原作--在任何时候，房间里只能容纳这么多的人。当然，在极端的情况下，有人会争论说，可能会给你一个矩阵式的体验，你认为你在卢浮宫的房间里看到了蒙娜丽莎，但事实上你从未离开过你的家。虽然在原则上是可能的，但我还是认为这还很遥远。 At first blush it might not seem that capital has much to do with addressing the allocation need, but historically we have definitely been capital constrained here. Two crucial parts of allocation solutions are communication and transportation. Sticking with the COVID vaccination example, in order to allocate a limited number of vaccines one needs to know where the people who should get the early doses are and how to get the doses to them (or them to the doses). Both of these sub problems require capital. In particular because the COVID vaccines need to be kept at low temperatures, it requires a so-called “cold chain” -- a logistics solution that can keep the vaccine cooled. Our progress in communication will be discussed more in the sections on motivation, coordination, and knowledge below. For transportation we know we are not really constrained given the massive amount of stuff (most of which is serving wants rather than needs) being delivered every day. 乍一看，似乎资本与解决分配需求没有太大关系，但从历史上看，我们在这里肯定受到了资本的制约。分配方案的两个关键部分是通信和运输。以COVID疫苗接种为例，为了分配数量有限的疫苗，我们需要知道应该获得早期剂量的人在哪里，以及如何将剂量送到他们手中（或他们拿到剂量）。这两个子问题都需要资本。特别是由于COVID疫苗需要在低温下保存，它需要一个所谓的 \"冷链\"--一个能够保持疫苗冷却的物流解决方案。我们在沟通方面的进展将在下面关于动机、协调和知识的章节中进一步讨论。对于运输，我们知道，鉴于每天都有大量的东西（其中大部分是为需求而服务的）被运送，我们并没有真正受到限制。 Motivation. This may seem like an individual need, but it acts as a collective one in the sense that societies must motivate their members to carry out important tasks and follow rules. Even the smallest and least technologically advanced societies have some solutions for this problem, often in the form of rewards and punishments. 激励。这似乎是一种个人需求，但它作为一种集体需求，社会必须激励其成员执行重要任务和遵守规则。即使是最小的、技术最不发达的社会也有一些解决这个问题的办法，通常是以奖惩的形式。 Motivation is another need where at first it might appear as if capital never really played a role. Yet on further examination, communication infrastructure is crucial for maintaining motivation across distance. This in no small part explains why the structures of motivation were for the most part extremely local prior to the industrial age and the deployment of communication networks. Successful larger motivation efforts earlier on, such as the Roman Empire, invested heavily in roads and/or currier networks. With communication networks operating at zero marginal cost today, we are no longer capital constrained with regard to motivation even at global scale. 激励是另一种需求，在这种需求中，起初可能会出现资本从未真正发挥作用的情况。然而，在进一步的研究中，通信基础设施对于保持跨距离的动机是至关重要的。这在很大程度上解释了为什么在工业时代和通信网络的部署之前，激励的结构大部分都是极其地方性的。早期成功的大型激励努力，如罗马帝国，在道路和/或快递网络上进行了大量的投资。今天，随着通信网络以零边际成本运行，即使在全球范围内，我们在激励方面也不再受到资本的限制。 Now to this day it might be argued that financial capital, e.g. in the form of bonus payments, is key to motivation. We are certainly not constrained by a lack of financial capital and we can even create new financial capital essentially ex nihilo via crypto currencies. Still it is worth pointing out that so-called “high powered” incentives are a very narrow form of motivation and require precise measurement to avoid substituting quantity for quality. This can easily be seen from the many failed attempts to incentivize the creation of content via payments in the absence of systems to rate content quality. 时至今日，人们可能会认为，金融资本，例如以奖金的形式，是激励的关键。我们当然不会受制于金融资本的缺乏，我们甚至可以通过加密货币创造新的金融资本，基本上是凭空而来。但仍然值得指出的是，所谓的 \"高能 \"激励是一种非常狭隘的激励形式，需要精确的衡量，以避免用数量代替质量。这一点可以从许多在缺乏内容质量评级系统的情况下，通过支付来激励内容创作的失败尝试中轻易看出。 Unlocking intrinsic motivation and complementing it with “low powered” incentives such as recognition and reputation is a far better approach most of the time. In science, for example, much progress comes from people’s genuine interest in solving a specific problem. Wikipedia is a great example of how much high quality content creation can happen in a system built solely on recognition and reputation (this is not to say that there aren’t bias issues worth addressing but commercial publishers time and again have argued that Wikipedia would run out of steam and it hasn’t). 在大多数情况下，释放内在动机并辅以 \"低动力 \"激励，如认可和声誉，是一种更好的方法。例如，在科学领域，许多进展来自于人们对解决特定问题的真正兴趣。维基百科是一个很好的例子，说明在一个完全建立在认可和声誉基础上的系统中，可以发生多少高质量的内容创作（这并不是说没有值得解决的偏见问题，但商业出版商一次又一次地认为维基百科会耗尽动力，而它并没有）。 Coordination. Whenever more than a single human is involved in any activity, coordination is needed. Take a simple meeting between two people as an example. In order for it to take place, the two need to show up at the same place at the same time. We have developed many communication and governance mechanisms to address this need. 协调。只要有超过一个人参与任何活动，就需要协调。以两个人之间的简单会议为例。为了使会议顺利进行，两人需要在同一时间出现在同一地点。我们已经开发了许多沟通和管理机制来满足这一需求。 Coordination may seem like such an abstract need that it can be difficult to see at first that it was at one point capital constrained. One of our primary solutions to the need for coordination is communication. Considering the simple example again of two people meeting, this requires agreeing on a place and time. When communication was really difficult (because of insufficient capital), a lot of meetings, such as religious ceremonies, happened on pre-ordained schedules. Another common solution was simply waiting. People would show up somewhere and wait until it was their turn. 协调可能看起来是如此抽象的需求，以至于一开始很难看到它曾一度受到资本的制约。我们对协调需求的主要解决方案之一是沟通。再考虑一下两个人见面这个简单的例子，这需要商定一个地点和时间。当沟通真的很困难时（因为资本不足），很多会议，如宗教仪式，都是按照预先设定的时间表进行的。另一个常见的解决方案是简单的等待。人们会出现在某个地方，然后等待，直到轮到他们。 This latter solution shows a great example of how we have achieved sufficient capital for coordination only relatively recently. Waiting as a solution to coordination has been decreasing rapidly in places with high internet penetration. For example, we now routinely book appointments for a haircut or make restaurant reservations online. At this point our ability to coordinate even at the scale of all of humanity is no longer capital constrained. Instead, most of our coordination problems now result from disagreements about priorities. That has been true most recently for fighting the COVID pandemic and is also true with what to do about the climate crisis. 后一种解决方案显示了一个很好的例子，说明我们只是在相对较近的时间内实现了足够的资本来协调。在互联网普及率高的地方，等待作为一种协调的解决方案已经在迅速减少了。例如，我们现在经常在网上预约理发或预订餐厅。在这一点上，我们的协调能力即使在全人类的规模上也不再受到资本的限制。相反，我们的大多数协调问题现在是由关于优先事项的分歧造成的。最近在抗击COVID大流行病方面就是如此，在如何应对气候危机方面也是如此。 Knowledge. As I argued in earlier sections on optimism and humanism, knowledge is the central collective human need: without it, a society will encounter problems that it cannot solve. History is full of examples of societies that lacked sufficient knowledge to sustain themselves, such as the Easter Islanders and the Mayans. This is not about what any one individual has learned, but about the body of knowledge that is accessible to society as a whole. Later in this book we will examine solutions for generating more knowledge, faster. 知识。正如我在前面关于乐观主义和人文主义的章节中所论述的，知识是人类的核心集体需求：没有知识，一个社会将遇到它无法解决的问题。历史上有很多社会缺乏足够的知识来维持自己的例子，如复活节岛民和玛雅人。这并不是说任何一个人学到了什么，而是说整个社会可以获得的知识体系。在本书的后面，我们将研究如何更快地产生更多知识的解决方案。 The accumulation of knowledge was significantly constrained by capital early on. That’s largely because humans didn’t know how to make easily writable and transportable materials. Many ancient cultures engraved writing in stone, which was both a slow process and made it difficult to transport the results. There was a series of innovations in recording materials such as parchment (animal skins), papyrus and eventually paper. To get a sense of just how scarce the more advanced materials were early on, one only needs to consider the so-called palimpsest, a manuscript that was written over a prior one, sometimes repeatedly, in the re-use of the underlying parchment (“Palimpsest,” 2021). With today’s digital technology for recording and transmitting knowledge we are no longer capital constrained with respect to those crucial aspects of the knowledge loop. 知识的积累在早期明显受到资本的制约。这主要是因为人类不知道如何制造容易书写和运输的材料。许多古代文化将文字刻在石头上，这既是一个缓慢的过程，也使其结果难以运输。在记录材料方面有一系列的创新，如羊皮纸（动物皮）、纸莎草，最后是纸。为了了解更先进的材料在早期是多么稀缺，我们只需要考虑所谓的 \"帛书\"，即在之前的手稿上书写的手稿，有时会重复使用下面的羊皮纸（\"帛书\"，2021年）。有了今天记录和传播知识的数字技术，我们在知识循环的这些关键方面不再受到资本的限制。 That is not to say that there aren’t some pockets of knowledge left where our ability to push forward is constrained by capital but these are few and far between. One example is high energy physics. The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is the biggest device humanity has built to explore what happens when particles collide at very high energies to reveal what they are made of (“Large Hadron Collider,” 2021). It is unclear that we have accumulated enough physical capital to date (or have the capacity right now to build enough) for significantly higher energy levels that would potentially let us see even deeper into the fabric of reality. 这并不是说没有一些知识的小块区域，我们推进的能力受到资本的限制，但这些小块区域很少，也很遥远。一个例子是高能物理学。大型强子对撞机（LHC）是人类建造的最大设备，用于探索粒子在非常高的能量下碰撞时会发生什么，以揭示它们是由什么组成的（\"大型强子对撞机\"，2021年）。目前还不清楚我们迄今为止是否已经积累了足够的物理资本（或现在有能力建造足够的物理资本），以达到明显更高的能量水平，这将有可能让我们更深入地看到现实的结构。 In the meantime though it is important to point out that conversely a lot of research that used to be capital constrained is no longer so through breakthroughs in both computation (allowing the simulation of much bigger systems) and laboratory equipment, especially for the sequencing and assembly of genomic information. This has resulted in an explosion in knowledge about cellular processes which among other benefits gave us the powerful new mRNA vaccines against COVID. 但与此同时，必须指出的是，通过计算（允许模拟更大的系统）和实验室设备的突破，特别是基因组信息的测序和组装，许多过去受资本限制的研究已不再如此。这导致了关于细胞过程的知识的爆炸性增长，除其他好处外，还为我们提供了强大的新mRNA疫苗来对抗COVID。 Energy. For a long time, humans relied on direct sunlight as their primary energy source. Since then we have developed many ways of generating energy, including better ways of capturing sunlight. Capturing more energy and making it available in concentrated and highly regulated form via electricity has enabled new solutions to human needs. 能源。在很长一段时间里，人类依靠阳光直接照射作为主要能源。从那时起，我们已经开发了许多产生能源的方法，包括更好的捕捉阳光的方法。捕捉更多的能量，并通过电力以集中和高度调节的形式提供，使人类需求得到了新的解决。 Energy turns out to be the crucial enabler of progres. The other enablers identified below, such as resources, are directly impacted by how much energy we have available. As David Deutsch has pointed out in “The Beginning of Infinity” a sufficiently advanced civilization, with enough energy at their disposal, could assemble entire worlds in seemingly empty space. 能源被证明是进步的关键因素。下面确定的其他推动因素，如资源，都直接受到我们有多少能源的影响。正如大卫-多伊奇在《无限的开端》中指出的那样，一个足够先进的文明，如果有足够的能源可供支配，可以在看似空旷的空间中组装出整个世界。 We are a long way from such a civilization but we have plenty of energy, and more importantly, the ability to rapidly build out our energy supply if we pay enough attention to it. Today energy production and consumption varies significantly across nations, with developed countries having enough energy far beyond what is required to meet needs. But even in the US we occasionally run into energy distribution problems as seen this year in Texas. 我们离这样的文明还有很长的路要走，但我们有大量的能源，更重要的是，如果我们足够重视，我们有能力迅速建立起我们的能源供应。今天，各国的能源生产和消费差异很大，发达国家拥有的能源远远超过了满足需要的程度。但即使在美国，我们偶尔也会遇到能源分配问题，就像今年在德克萨斯州看到的那样。 More importantly globally our energy production is heavily dependent on fossil fuels. This of course is the cause of the climate crisis and something that requires our urgent attention. So isn’t this an example of capital scarcity? No. We have the capital necessary to dramatically ramp our clean energy supply, we simply lack the political will to go into wartime production mode. We should be building out wind, solar, geothermal, and nuclear energy (as well as storage) with a large percentage of our existing physical capital. 更重要的是，在全球范围内，我们的能源生产严重依赖化石燃料。这当然是气候危机的原因，也是需要我们迫切关注的事情。那么，这不是资本稀缺的一个例子吗？不，我们有必要的资本来大幅提高我们的清洁能源供应，我们只是缺乏政治意愿来进入战时生产模式。我们应该用我们现有的大部分物质资本来建设风能、太阳能、地热能和核能（以及储存）。 To illustrate what is possible, consider France’s deployment of nuclear energy in the 1970s and 80s. France went from virtually no nuclear power to about 40% in the space of less than two decades (Mearns, 2013). Keep in mind this was during a peacetime approach to energy. Now imagine what could be done with a wartime approach. I believe it would be possible in most countries to get to 100% clean energy in 10 years or possibly even faster if we really tried. 为了说明什么是可能的，考虑法国在20世纪70年代和80年代的核能部署。在不到二十年的时间里，法国从几乎没有核电到约40%（Mearns，2013）。请记住，这是在和平时期的能源方法。现在想象一下，战时的方法可以做什么。我相信在大多数国家，如果我们真的努力，有可能在10年内达到100%的清洁能源，甚至可能更快。 Finally, there seems to be no particular reason why we cannot make even more advanced forms of energy work, starting with nuclear fusion. There’s now at least a dozen well funded commercial fusion startups pursuing a variety of approaches from the longstanding magnetic confinement to more recent inertial confinement (using laser). Research has even continued on the much derided notion of “cold” fusion. Following the reproducibility crisis of the original 1989 paper by Fleischmann and Pons, research has been continued albeit under the different headline of “condensed matter physics.” (Krivit & Ravnitzky, 2016). That research has continued to provide interesting observations that could eventually unlock a massive energy source for humanity. 最后，我们似乎没有特别的理由不能使更先进的能源形式发挥作用，首先是核聚变。现在至少有十几家资金充足的商业核聚变初创公司在追求各种方法，从长期的磁约束到最近的惯性约束（使用激光）。甚至对被嘲笑的 \"冷 \"核聚变概念的研究也在继续。在弗莱施曼和庞斯1989年发表的原始论文的可重复性危机之后，研究一直在继续，尽管是在 \"凝聚态物理学 \"的不同标题下。(Krivit & Ravnitzky, 2016)。这项研究继续提供有趣的观察，最终可能为人类打开一个巨大的能源。 Resources. In early human history, all resources were drawn from our natural surroundings. Later, we started growing and extracting resources in our own right. Many modern solutions have been made possible by access to new kinds of resources. For instance, mobile phones, which provide new solutions to individual and collective needs, are made possible by some esoteric raw materials, including the so-called rare-earth elements. 资源。在早期的人类历史上，所有的资源都是从我们的自然环境中提取。后来，我们开始以自己的方式种植和提取资源。许多现代解决方案都是通过获取新型资源而实现的。例如，移动电话为个人和集体需求提供了新的解决方案，它是由一些神秘的原材料，包括所谓的稀土元素*实现的。 One of the consistent worries cited for why we will not be able to meet our needs are resources, by which I mean raw and intermediate materials. For example, there is a concern now about running out of phosphorus (Alewell et al., 2020). Historically, this has not turned out to be the case for several reasons. First, when a resource becomes more expensive, we often start to discover new places where we can find it. For instance, there were repeated concerns that we might run out of oil, but each time we discovered more. Second, an increase in the price of a resource tends to lead to product and process designs that make less use of the resource, either by becoming more efficient or by substituting another resource. Third, when a resource is sufficiently expensive it makes sense to recycle it. For example, in the US about half of all aluminum beer cans are recycled (EPA, 2021). 为什么我们将无法满足我们的需求，所引用的一致的担忧之一是资源，我指的是原材料和中间材料。例如，现在人们担心磷会耗尽（Alewell等人，2020）。从历史上看，这并不是事实，原因有几个。首先，当一种资源变得更加昂贵时，我们往往开始发现可以找到它的新地方。例如，人们曾多次担心我们可能会耗尽石油，但每次我们都会发现更多的石油。第二，一种资源价格的提高往往会导致产品和工艺设计减少对该资源的使用，要么变得更有效率，要么用另一种资源来替代。第三，当一种资源足够昂贵时，对其进行回收利用是有意义的。例如，在美国，大约一半的铝制啤酒罐被回收利用（EPA，2021）。 Ultimately though there are far more resources in the universe than we might ever need. In the relatively near future we will be able to catch meteorites, which contain massive amounts of metals. There are several venture backed startups pursuing this and companies such as SpaceX are driving down the cost of launching such missions. Longer term though we will likely be able to transmute materials. Our techniques for doing this at the moment are somewhat primitive but famously Gleen Seaborg and others turned bismuth into gold in 1981 (Aleklett et al., 1981). 虽然最终宇宙中的资源远远超过我们可能需要的数量。在相对较近的将来，我们将能够捕捉陨石，其中包含大量的金属。有几家由风险投资支持的初创公司在追求这个目标，像SpaceX这样的公司正在降低发射此类任务的成本。但从长远来看，我们将可能能够对材料进行转化。目前，我们的技术有点原始，但著名的Gleen Seaborg和其他人在1981年将铋变成了金（Aleklett等人，1981）。 Transformation. Energy and resources alone are not enough. To enable most solutions, we need to figure out (and remember!) how to use the former to transform the latter. This involves chemical and physical processes. Physical capital, in the shape of machines, has been a crucial enabler of many new solutions to human needs. For instance, a knitting machine can quickly transform yarn into clothing, one of our key solutions for maintaining the human operating environment. 转化。仅有能源和资源是不够的。为了实现大多数解决方案，我们需要弄清楚（并记住！）如何使用前者来转化后者。这涉及化学和物理过程。物理资本，以机器的形式出现，一直是许多满足人类需求的新解决方案的重要推动者。例如，一台针织机可以快速地将纱线转化为衣服，这是我们维护人类操作环境的关键解决方案之一*。 Some of the earliest human transformation processes were to make weapons for hunting, such as arrows and knives, by sharpening wood or stone. Eventually we figured out how to make metals and developed lots of chemical processes that combine and transform resources into the materials we use every day. Many of these processes are capital intensive. 人类最早的一些转化过程是通过磨碎木头或石头来制造狩猎用的武器，如箭和刀子。最终，我们想出了如何制造金属，并开发了许多化学工艺，将资源组合和转化为我们每天使用的材料。这些过程中有许多是资本密集型的。 Yet here too it is unlikely that we are meaningfully constrained by capital in many parts of the world. One example to consider here is how much larger cars have become in recent years in advanced economies. This has been driven by the trend towards Sports Utility Vehicles (SUV) and so-called Crossovers which have been dramatically outselling traditional sedans since 2015 (Motorlease, n.d.). These vehicles require significantly more material due to their size. One can give similar examples from other areas, such as the trend of much larger houses. In the US in 2014 the average new home had ballooned to 2,675 square feet from below 1,000 square feet in the 1950s (while at the same time average family size shrunk considerably). Put differently we may have distribution issues but we do not have aggregate capital constraint issues in making materials. 然而，在这里，我们也不太可能在世界许多地方受到资本的有意义的限制。这里要考虑的一个例子是，近年来在发达经济体中，汽车变得越来越大了。这是由运动型多功能车（SUV）和所谓的跨界车的趋势推动的，自2015年以来，这些车的销量已经大大超过了传统的轿车（Motorlease, n.d.）。这些车辆由于其尺寸，需要更多的材料。我们可以从其他领域举出类似的例子，如更大的房子的趋势。在美国，2014年，平均新房面积从20世纪50年代的1000平方英尺以下膨胀到2675平方英尺（与此同时，平均家庭规模大幅缩减）。换句话说，我们可能有分销问题，但我们没有制造材料的总资本约束问题。 It is also worth noting that much of our manufacturing is still applying highly wasteful processes where one starts with a big piece of material and then cuts or mills portions away. In contrast to this we are now beginning to see additive manufacturing, sometimes referred to as 3D printing, growing in capabilities. In this approach material is deposited to take on the desired shapes which allows for a dramatic reduction in waste. 同样值得注意的是，我们的许多制造业仍然在应用高度浪费的工艺，即从一大块材料开始，然后切割或铣削部分。与此相反，我们现在开始看到增材制造，有时被称为3D打印，其能力在不断增长。在这种方法中，材料被沉积成所需的形状，从而大大减少了浪费。 Transportation. The final foundational enabler is the ability to move stuff, including people. This is another area in which we have made great progress, going from human-powered to animal-powered to machine-powered transportation. 交通。最后一个基础性的推动因素是移动东西的能力，包括人。这是我们取得巨大进展的另一个领域，从人力驱动到动物驱动再到机器驱动的运输。 Humanity was capital constrained on transportation for a long time and still is in some parts of the world today. Without some kind of assistance we are quite slow (certainly compared to many other species) and cannot cross sizable bodies of water. Not surprisingly then much of early human technology was aimed at improving transportation, from domesticating animals such as horses to inventing the boats and carriages. 在很长一段时间里，人类在运输方面受到资本的限制，今天在世界的某些地方仍然如此。如果没有某种援助，我们的速度相当慢（当然与许多其他物种相比），而且不能跨越相当大的水体。因此，从驯化马匹等动物到发明船只和马车，早期人类的大部分技术都是为了改善交通，这并不奇怪。 The longstanding dream of course was to fly like birds with myths of human flight, such as Daedalus and Icarus, dating back thousands of years. It wound up taking until the early 1900s to figure it out though. From there progress was rapid and by 1969 a human had landed on the moon. Following the COVID pandemic, we are finding ourselves with an excess of equipment with more planes than ever before parked in the desert, maybe never to be reactivated. 长期以来的梦想当然是像鸟类一样飞翔，人类飞行的神话，如代达罗斯和伊卡洛斯，可以追溯到数千年前。然而，直到20世纪初，人们才想出这个办法。从那时起，进展迅速，到1969年，人类已经在月球上着陆。在COVID大流行之后，我们发现自己的设备过剩，比以往任何时候都多的飞机停在沙漠中，也许永远不会被重新启用。 Today we face two overlapping challenges. Some parts of the world still need to catch up on transportation, in particular India and China with their billions of people hankering for increased mobility. At the same time we need to rapidly decarbonize transportation all over the world in order to combat the climate crisis. Achieving both will require massive investments in electric mobility. Ideally new vehicles in India and China will be predominantly EVs, including electric scooters and trikes. We are not really constrained by capital in accomplishing this but only if we make the choice to redeploy a lot of productive capital. 今天，我们面临着两个重叠的挑战。世界上的一些地区仍然需要在交通方面迎头赶上，特别是印度和中国，他们有数十亿人口渴望增加流动性。同时，为了应对气候危机，我们需要在全世界范围内迅速实现交通脱碳。要实现这两个目标，需要对电动汽车进行大规模投资。理想情况下，印度和中国的新车将以电动车为主，包括电动踏板车和三轮车。在完成这一目标时，我们其实不受资本的限制，但前提是我们要选择重新部署大量的生产性资本。 "},"docs/References.html":{"url":"docs/References.html","title":"参考文献","keywords":"","body":"1854 Broad Street cholera outbreak.
