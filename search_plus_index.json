But I think that’s a boring interpretation of the question. These trends come and go as part of hype cycles that represent the waxing and waning of media interest in a particular technology. Instead I answer, “Oh, nothing much—just the end of the Industrial Age.” That momentous change is the subject of this book. 作为一名风险资本家，我经常被问到： \"下一个大事情是什么？\" 人们往往在寻找技术趋势时问这个问题，希望我跟他们谈谈机器人技术或虚拟现实。但我认为这是对这个问题的无聊解释。这些趋势来来去去都是炒作周期的一部分，代表了媒体对某一特定技术兴趣的消长变化。相反，我回答说：\"哦，没什么--只是工业时代的结束。\" 这一重大变化是本书的主题。 The World After Capital is unabashedly about some truly big subjects. In order to tackle why the Industrial Age is ending and what is coming next, I will examine such things as the nature of technology and what it means to be human. It might seem a wildly ambitious thesis, but I argue that we are facing a transition as profound as the one which took humanity from the Agrarian Age to the Industrial Age, so nothing less will do. 《资本之后的世界》毫不掩饰地讲述了一些真正的大主题。为了解决工业时代即将结束的原因，以及接下来会发生什么，我将研究技术的性质和人类的意义等问题。这似乎是一个雄心勃勃的论题，但我认为我们正面临着一个深刻的转变，就像人类从农业时代到工业时代的转变一样，所以没有什么比这更重要了。 The current transition has been made possible by the advent of digital technology, so it is essential that we understand the nature of this technology and how it differs from what preceded it. It is also essential that we examine the philosophical foundations of what we want to accomplish—after all, we have the opportunity to decide what will follow the Industrial Age. In The World After Capital I argue that we are now entering the Knowledge Age, and that in order to get there we must focus on the allocation of attention rather than capital. 目前的转型由于数字技术的出现而成为可能，因此，我们必须了解这种技术的性质，以及它与之前的技术有什么不同。同样重要的是，我们要研究我们想要完成的事情的哲学基础--毕竟，我们有机会决定工业时代之后的事情。在《资本之后的世界》中，我认为我们现在正在进入知识时代，为了达到这个目的，我们必须关注注意力的分配，而不是资本。 Markets fail at allocating attention because prices cannot exist for directing our attention to problems and opportunities most crucial for the survival and thriving of humanity. The climate crisis, for instance, is both more severe and more imminent than most people realize, and it is a direct result of our failure to pay attention. How quickly we address this crisis will to a great extent determine the shape of the current transition. If we do not make drastic changes quickly, getting to the next age will be even more painful than the transition to the Industrial Age, which started in the eighteenth century, involved numerous violent revolutions, and didn’t conclude until the end of the Second World War. 市场在分配注意力方面失败了，因为不能存在价格来引导我们关注对人类的生存和繁荣最关键的问题和机会。例如，气候危机比大多数人意识到的更严重、更紧迫，它是我们未能关注的直接结果。我们如何迅速解决这一危机将在很大程度上决定当前转型的形式。如果我们不迅速做出巨大的改变，进入下一个时代将比向工业时代的过渡更加痛苦，后者始于 18 世纪，涉及无数次暴力革命，直到第二次世界大战结束才结束。 The transition from the Industrial Age is already underway, and has caused massive disruption and uncertainty. Many people are fearful of change, and react by supporting populist politicians who promote the simplistic message that we should return to the past. This is happening all over the world. We saw it with the vote in the 2016 UK referendum to leave the European Union, and with the election of Donald Trump as President of the United States in the same year. I started writing The World After Capital before both of those events, but they underline the importance of a future-oriented narrative that shows a path forward for humanity. Going back is not a viable option, and never has been. We did not continue foraging for food after the invention of agriculture, nor did we remain farmers after the invention of industry (farming is still important, of course, but it is carried out by a tiny percentage of the population). Each of these transitions required us to find new sources of purpose. As we leave the Industrial Age behind, our purpose can no longer be derived from having a job or from an ever-growing consumption of material goods. Instead, we need to find a purpose that is compatible with the Knowledge Age. I feel incredibly fortunate to have found my purpose in advancing innovation through investing in startups, as well as in examining why this transition is happening now and suggesting how we might go about it. 从工业时代的过渡已经在进行中，并造成了巨大的破坏和不确定性。许多人对变化感到恐惧，他们的反应是支持民粹主义政客，宣传我们应该回到过去的简单信息。这种情况正在世界各地发生。我们看到，在 2016 年英国公投中，人们投票决定离开欧盟，同年唐纳德-特朗普当选美国总统，也是如此。我在这两个事件之前就开始写*《资本之后的世界》，但它们强调了面向未来的叙事的重要性，为人类指明了前进的道路。回归不是一个可行的选择，而且从来都不是。在农业发明之后，我们没有继续觅食，在工业发明之后，我们也没有继续当农民（当然，耕作仍然很重要，但它是由极小部分的人口进行的）。这些过渡都要求我们找到新的目的来源。当我们离开工业时代时，我们的目的不能再从拥有一份工作或从不断增长的物质产品消费中获得。相反，我们需要找到一个与知识时代相适应的目的。我感到非常幸运的是，我在通过投资初创企业来推动创新方面找到了自己的目的，同时也在研究为什么现在正在发生这种转变，并建议我们如何去做。 In a strange and wonderful way, much of what I have done in my life so far has brought me to this point. As a teenager in my native Germany in the early 1980s, I fell in love with computers. I started writing software for companies and then studied economics and computer science as an undergraduate at Harvard, writing my senior thesis on the impact of computerized trading on stock prices. After graduating I worked as a consultant and experienced the impact of information systems on the automotive, airline and electric utility industries. As a doctoral student at MIT, I wrote my dissertation on the impact of information technology on the organization of companies. As an entrepreneur, I co-founded an early Internet healthcare company. And as a venture investor, I have had the good fortune to back companies that provide transformative digital technologies and services, including Etsy, MongoDB and Twilio. 以一种奇怪而奇妙的方式，迄今为止我在生活中所做的大部分事情都把我带到了这一点上。20 世纪 80 年代初，在我的家乡德国，我还是个少年，就爱上了计算机。我开始为公司编写软件，然后在哈佛大学读本科时学习经济学和计算机科学，写了一篇关于计算机化交易对股票价格影响的毕业论文。毕业后，我担任了顾问，体验了信息系统对汽车、航空和电力行业的影响。作为麻省理工学院的博士生，我的论文写的是信息技术对公司组织的影响。作为一名企业家，我与他人共同创办了一家早期的互联网保健公司。而作为一个风险投资者，我有幸支持了那些提供变革性数字技术和服务的公司，包括 Etsy、MongoDB 和 Twilio。 You might be wondering why I would choose to write this book as a VC—after all, surely it’s a distraction from finding and managing investments in startups? However, working with startups gives me a window into the future: I get to see trends and developments before they become widely understood, and this puts me in a good position to write about what is going to happen. At the same time, writing about the future that I would like to see will help me find companies that can help bring that future about. I am writing The World After Capital because what I see compels me to do so, but I am also confident that writing it has made me a better investor. 你可能会想，为什么我会选择以风险投资人的身份来写这本书--毕竟，这肯定会分散我对寻找和管理初创企业投资的注意力？然而，与初创企业一起工作给了我一个了解未来的窗口： 我可以在趋势和发展被广泛了解之前看到它们，这使我处于一个很好的位置来写即将发生的事情。同时，撰写我希望看到的未来，将有助于我找到能够帮助实现这一未来的公司。我写《资本之后的世界》*是因为我看到的东西迫使我这样做，但我也相信，写这本书使我成为一个更好的投资者。 "},"Introduction.html":{"url":"Introduction.html","title":"引言","keywords":"","body":"1. 引言1. 引言 Humanity is the only species on Earth to have developed knowledge. I will make the term ‘knowledge’ increasingly precise as we go along, but for now I will simply say that we are the only species that is able to read and write, and that this ability in turn has allowed us to create increasingly powerful technology. Technological advance has the effect of broadening the ‘space of the possible’: for instance, with the invention of the airplane, human flight became a reality. When the ‘space of the possible’ is broadened, it brings with it both good and bad capabilities. This duality of technology has been with us since we learned to start a fire, the very first human technology. With this discovery, it became possible to warm ourselves and cook, but also to burn down forests and enemy villages. Today, the Internet broadens free access to learning, but it can also spread hate and lies on a global scale. 人类是地球上唯一发展了知识的物种。随着时间的推移，我将使 \"知识 \"一词越来越精确，但现在我只想说，我们是唯一能够阅读和书写的物种，而这种能力反过来又使我们能够创造出越来越强大的技术。技术进步具有扩大 \"可能空间 \"的作用：例如，随着飞机的发明，人类飞行成为现实。当 \"可能的空间 \"被扩大时，它带来了好的和坏的能力。自从我们学会生火以来，技术的这种双重性一直伴随着我们，这是人类最早的技术。有了这一发现，我们就可以取暖和做饭，但也可以烧毁森林和敌人的村庄。今天，互联网扩大了自由学习的机会，但它也可以在全球范围内传播仇恨和谎言。 And yet there is something special about our time: we are experiencing a technological non-linearity, in which the ‘space of the possible’ expands dramatically, thus rendering predictions based on extrapolation useless. The current non-linearity arises from the extraordinary power of digital technology, which far exceeds anything that was possible with industrial machinery, due to two unique characteristics. Digital technology delivers universality of computation (it can potentially solve any solvable problem) at zero marginal cost (extra copies can be produced for free). 然而，我们的时代有一些特别之处：我们正在经历一场技术上的非线性，其中 \"可能的空间 \"急剧扩大，从而使基于推断的预测变得无用。目前的非线性产生于数字技术的非凡力量，由于两个独特的特点，它远远超过了工业机械的任何可能。数字技术提供了计算的普遍性（它可以潜在地解决任何可解决的问题），而且边际成本为零（可以免费生产额外的副本）。 To understand what is happening, we therefore need to zoom out in time. Humanity has previously encountered two similar non-linearities. The first occurred roughly ten thousand years ago with the invention of agriculture, which ended the Forager Age and brought us into the Agrarian Age. The second started with the Enlightenment about four hundred years ago, which helped usher in the Industrial Age. 因此，为了理解正在发生的事情，我们需要将时间放大。人类以前曾遇到过两次类似的非线性现象。第一次大约发生在一万年前，农业的发明结束了采集-狩猎时代，使我们进入了农业时代。第二次发生在大约四百年前的启蒙运动，它帮助我们进入了工业时代。 Consider foragers one hundred thousand years ago, trying to predict what society would look like after the invention of agriculture. Even something that seems as trivially obvious to us as living in buildings would be hard to imagine from the viewpoint of migratory tribes. Similarly, much of what we have today—from modern medicine to computer technology—would resemble magic to those living as recently as the mid-twentieth century. Not simply the existence of smartphones, but also the widespread availability and affordability of such powerful technology, would have been hard to foresee. 考虑一下十万年前的采集-狩猎者，试图预测农业发明后社会会是什么样子。即使是像住在楼房里这样对我们来说似乎微不足道的事情，从迁徙部落的角度来看也是难以想象的。同样，我们今天所拥有的大部分东西--从现代医学到计算机技术--对于那些生活在二十世纪中期的人来说，就像魔术一样。不仅仅是智能手机的存在，还有这种强大技术的广泛可用性和可负担性，都是难以预见的。 The World After Capital has two goals. The first is to establish that we are currently experiencing a third period of globally transformative, non-linear change. The key argument is that each time, the ‘space of the possible’ expands dramatically, the defining constraint for humanity shifts—meaning the allocation problem that most fundamentally needs to be solved in order to meet humanity’s needs changes. Specifically, the invention of agriculture shifted scarcity from food to land, and industrialization shifted scarcity from land to capital (which throughout The World After Capital refers to physical capital, such as machines and buildings, unless otherwise noted). Digital technology is now shifting scarcity from capital to attention. 资本之后的世界有两个目标。第一个目标是确定我们目前正在经历第三个全球转型、非线性变化的时期。关键的论点是，每一次，\"可能的空间 \"急剧扩大，人类的决定性制约因素就会发生变化--也就是说，为了满足人类的需求，最根本的需要解决的分配问题就会发生变化。具体来说，农业的发明将稀缺性从食物转移到了土地，而工业化将稀缺性从土地转移到了资本（除非另有说明，在《资本之后的世界》中，资本指的是物质资本，如机器和建筑物）。现在，数字技术正在将稀缺性从资本转移到注意力。 Capital is no longer scarce in some parts of the world and it is becoming rapidly less scarce everywhere. We should consider this to be the great success of capitalism. But markets, which were the crucial allocation mechanism for capital, will not solve the scarcity of attention. We are bad at allocating attention, both individually and collectively. For example, how much attention do you pay to your friends and family, or to the existential question of the meaning of your life? And how much attention are we paying as humanity to the great challenges and opportunities of our time, such as the climate crisis and space travel? Markets are not able to help us better allocate attention because prices do not, and cannot, exist for many of the issues that we should be paying attention to. Consider paying attention to finding your purpose in life: there is no supply and demand that will form a ‘purpose price’ for an individual; it’s ultimately up to you to allocate enough attention to this existential question. 资本在世界的某些地方不再稀缺，而且在各地的稀缺程度也在迅速降低。我们应该认为这是资本主义的巨大成功。但是，作为资本的重要分配机制的市场，并不能解决注意力的稀缺性问题。我们不善于分配注意力，无论是个人还是集体。例如，你对你的朋友和家人，或者对你生命的意义这一存在性问题有多少关注？而作为人类，我们对我们这个时代的巨大挑战和机遇，如气候危机和太空旅行，又有多少关注？市场无法帮助我们更好地分配注意力，因为对于许多我们应该关注的问题，价格并不存在，也不可能存在。考虑关注寻找你的人生目标：没有任何供求关系会形成一个人的 \"目标价格\"；最终取决于你是否对这个存在的问题分配足够的关注。 My second goal in writing The World After Capital is to propose an approach that will help us overcome the limitations and remedy the shortcomings of market-based capitalism, in order to facilitate a smooth transition from the Industrial Age (in which the key scarcity is capital) to the Knowledge Age (in which the key scarcity is attention). Getting this right will be critical for humanity, as the two previous transitions were marked by massive turmoil and upheaval. We are already seeing signs of increasing conflict within societies and among belief systems across the world, fueling a rise of populist and nationalist leaders, including Donald Trump in the US. 我写《资本之后的世界》的第二个目标是提出一种方法，帮助我们克服以市场为基础的资本主义的局限性并弥补其缺陷，以促进从工业时代（其中关键的稀缺性是资本）向知识时代（其中关键的稀缺性是注意力）顺利过渡。把握好这一点对人类来说至关重要，因为前两次转型的特点是大规模的动荡和骚乱。我们已经看到世界各地的社会内部和信仰体系之间的冲突越来越多的迹象，助长了民粹主义和民族主义领导人的崛起，包括美国的唐纳德-特朗普。 How should we approach this third transition? What actions should society take now, when the non-linearity we are facing prevents us from being able to make accurate predictions about the future? We need to enact policies that allow for gradual social and economic change. The alternative is that we artificially suppress these changes, only for them to explode eventually. In particular, I will argue that we should smooth the transition to the Knowledge Age by expanding three powerful individual freedoms: Economic freedom: instituting a universal basic income. Informational freedom: broadening access to information and computation. Psychological freedom: practicing and encouraging mindfulness. 我们应该如何对待这第三次转型？当我们所面临的非线性使我们无法对未来做出准确的预测时，社会现在应该采取什么行动？我们需要制定政策，允许社会和经济的逐步变化。另一种选择是，我们人为地压制这些变化，但最终它们会爆发出来。特别是，我将论证，我们应该通过扩大三种强大的个人自由来平稳过渡到知识时代： 经济自由：实施普遍基本收入。 信息自由：扩大信息和计算的获取渠道。 心理自由：实践和鼓励正念。 Increasing these three freedoms will make attention less scarce. Economic freedom will unlock the time that we currently spend in jobs that can and should be automated. Informational freedom will accelerate the creation and distribution of knowledge. And psychological freedom enables rationality in a world in which we are overloaded with information. Each of these freedoms is important in its own right, but they are also mutually reinforcing. 增加这三种自由将会使得注意力不再那么紧缺。经济自由将会释放我们当前在那些可以和应该被自动化的工作中所花费的时间。信息自由将会加速知识的创造和传播。而心理自由则使我们在这个信息过载的世界中能够更理性地处理问题。每一种自由都有其重要性，但它们也是相互支持的。 One crucial goal in reducing the scarcity of attention is to improve the functioning of the ‘knowledge loop’, which is the source of all knowledge and which consists of learning, creating and sharing. Producing more knowledge is essential to human progress. The history of humanity is littered with failed civilizations that didn’t produce enough knowledge to overcome the challenges facing them. 降低注意力稀缺的一个至关重要的目标是改善“知识循环”的功能，这是所有知识的源泉，由学习、创造和分享组成。生产更多的知识对于人类的进步至关重要。人类的历史上充满了失败的文明，它们没有产生足够的知识来克服面临的挑战。 To achieve collective progress through increased individual freedoms, we must establish a set of values that include critical inquiry, democracy and responsibility. These values ensure that the benefits of the knowledge loop accrue broadly to humanity and extend to other species. They are central to a renewed humanism, which in turn has an objective basis in the existence and power of human knowledge. Reasserting humanism is especially critical at a time when we are coming close to creating ‘transhumans’ through genetic engineering and augmentation, as well as ‘neohumans’ through artificial intelligence. 为了通过增加个体自由实现集体进步，我们必须确立一组价值观，包括批判性探究、民主和责任。这些价值观确保知识循环的好处广泛地惠及人类并延伸到其他物种。它们是一种重新振兴的人道主义的核心，而这种人道主义又以人类知识的存在和力量为客观基础。在我们即将通过基因工程和增强技术创造“超人类”以及通过人工智能创造“新人类”之际，重新确立人道主义尤其关键。 The World After Capital argues that only this combination of increased freedoms and strong humanist values will allow us to safely navigate the transition from the Industrial Age to the Knowledge Age. Though I am profoundly optimistic about the ultimate potential for human progress, I am pessimistic about how we will get there. We seem intent on clinging to the Industrial Age at all costs, which increases the likelihood of violent change. My hope is that in writing this book I can in some small way help to move us forward peacefully. 《资本之后的世界》认为，只有这种增加自由和强有力的人文主义价值观的结合，才能使我们安全地度过从工业时代到知识时代的过渡期。尽管我对人类进步的最终潜力深感乐观，但我对我们将如何达到这一目标感到悲观。我们似乎有意不惜一切代价坚持工业时代，这增加了暴力变革的可能性。我希望通过写这本书，我可以以某种小小的方式帮助我们和平地向前迈进。 "}}
